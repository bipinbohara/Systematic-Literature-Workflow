MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as key regulators of gene expression, play an important role in steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head. OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively analyze the regulatory role of miRNAs in steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head and to evaluate their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic tools. METHODS: Relevant literature was retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, and WanFang databases using specific keywords, and articles were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. By reading titles, abstracts, or full texts, articles with poor relevance or repetitive content were excluded, and 76 articles were finally included for analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: miRNAs regulate gene expression by binding to the 3' untranslated region of target mRNAs, affecting cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and stress responses. Specific miRNAs such as miR-33-5p, miR-99a, miR-106b-5p, miR-155, miR-146a, and miR-21 play a central regulatory role in vascular injury, inflammatory responses, osteocyte differentiation, and apoptosis in steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Additionally, the expression patterns of miRNAs are closely related to the pathogenesis of steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head, showing potential as biomarkers. Although miRNAs shows great potential as biomarkers in therapeutic strategies, the current limitation of sample size and lack of multipopulation validation restrict the universality and reliability of the results. Moreover, the efficacy and safety of miRNA therapeutic strategies (including offtarget effects and delivery issues) remain major challenges in realizing clinical applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010705697

However, the impact of intramedullary pressure (IMP) on the fluid behavior of interstitial fluid in bone remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of IMP on the fluid flow behavior in the Haversian canals and lacuno-canalicular network (LCN). This study established a multiscale finite element model of bone tissue based on the theory of poroelasticity, considering the interconnection of different pore scales such as bone marrow cavity, Haversian canals, and LCN. The effects of IMP frequency and amplitude on Haversian canal pore pressure (p<inf>Hc</inf>) and flow velocity (v<inf>Hc</inf>), as well as on LCN pore pressure (p<inf>lc</inf>), flow velocity (v<inf>lc</inf>), and fluid shear stress (τ), were analyzed. In this model, we assumed that IMP is a pulsating liquid pressure that is synchronized with arterial blood pressure and respiration, located within the bone marrow cavity and acting on the inner wall of bone tissue. We considered the stepwise conduction of pore pressure at different pore scales. As the initial pressure condition of the overall model, IMP was calculated to obtain p<inf>Hc</inf> and v<inf>Hc</inf>, while p<inf>Hc</inf> was calculated as the initial pressure condition of the next scale model to obtain p<inf>lc</inf>, v<inf>lc</inf>, and τ. The results indicated that IMP had a significant impact on the fluid flow of bone. The p<inf>Hc</inf> and p<inf>lc</inf> significantly increased with the increase in IMP amplitude, and the frequency of IMP had a significant impact on the peak p<inf>Hc</inf> over time. The multilevel pore model established in this study provides a more accurate analysis of the fluid flow behavior within bones, which is of great significance for a deeper understanding of bone internal force conduction and is crucial for a better understanding of bone adaptation based on IMP. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015063185

Platelet lysate exosomes have emerged as a potential therapeutic intervention due to their anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties. This study aimed to investigate the effect of platelet lysate exosomes on reducing levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), E-selectin, creatinine, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), malondialdehyde (MDA), and caspase-3 in sepsis model rats. A post-test-only experimental study was conducted on 36 Sprague-Dawley rats divided into six groups: (K1) healthy control, (K2) sepsis model, (K3) sepsis model with standard therapy, (K4) sepsis model with 10 μl platelet lysate exosome therapy, (K5) sepsis model with a combination of standard treatment and 10 μl platelet lysate exosome, and (K6) sepsis model with 20 μl platelet lysate exosome therapy. Blood serum CRP, E-selectin, creatinine, NGAL, MDA, and caspase-3 levels were measured using ELISA. The results demonstrated that CRP, E-selectin, creatinine, NGAL, MDA, and caspase-3 levels were highest in the sepsis-only group (K2) and lowest in the healthy control group (K1). A significant gradual reduction (p<0.05) was observed across treatment groups (K3-K6), with no significant difference between K5 and K6 (p>0.05). These findings demonstrate a synergistic effect when platelet lysate exosomes are combined with standard therapy. Integrating platelet lysate exosomes with current standard treatments could enhance therapeutic outcomes in sepsis and warrants further investigation in clinical studies to explore their translational potential. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015205573

Moreover, the extensive and long-term medical care required for spinal cord injury significantly increases healthcare costs and resources, adding a substantial burden to the healthcare system and patients’ families. In this context, chondroitinase ABC, a bacterial enzyme isolated from Proteus vulgaris that is modified to facilitate expression and secretion in mammals, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent. It works by degrading chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, cleaving the glycosaminoglycanchains of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans into soluble disaccharides or tetrasaccharides. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are potent axon growth inhibitors and principal constituents of the extracellular matrix surrounding glial and neuronal cells attached to glycosaminoglycan chains. Chondroitinase ABC has been shown to play an effective role in promoting recovery from acute and chronic spinal cord injury by improving axonal regeneration and sprouting, enhancing the plasticity of perineuronal nets, inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, and modulating immune responses in various animal models. In this review, we introduce the classification and pathological mechanisms of spinal cord injury and discuss the pathophysiological role of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in spinal cord injury. We also highlight research advancements in spinal cord injury treatment strategies, with a focus on chondroitinase ABC, and illustrate how improvements in chondroitinase ABC stability, enzymatic activity, and delivery methods have enhanced injured spinal cord repair. Furthermore, we emphasize that combination treatment with chondroitinase ABC further enhances therapeutic efficacy. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current trends and future directions of chondroitinase ABC-based spinal cord injury therapies, with an emphasis on how modern technologies are accelerating the optimization of chondroitinase ABC development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010947807

Altogether, the burden of neurological disorders has increased considerably over the past 30 years because of population aging. Overall, neurological diseases significantly impair cognitive and motor functions and their incidence will increase as societies age and the world’s population continues to grow. Autism spectrum disorder, motor neuron disease, encephalopathy, epilepsy, stroke, ataxia, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease represent a non-exhaustive list of neurological illnesses. These affections are due to perturbations in cellular homeostasis leading to the progressive injury and death of neurons in the nervous system. Among the common features of neurological handicaps, we find protein aggregation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial impairment in the target tissues, e.g., the brain, cerebellum, and spinal cord. The high energy requirements of neurons and their inability to produce sufficient adenosine triphosphate by glycolysis, are responsible for their dependence on functional mitochondria for their integrity. Reactive oxygen species, produced along with the respiration process within mitochondria, can lead to oxidative stress, which compromises neuronal survival. Besides having an essential role in energy production and oxidative stress, mitochondria are indispensable for an array of cellular processes, such as amino acid metabolism, iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, calcium homeostasis, intrinsic programmed cell death (apoptosis), and intraorganellar signaling. Despite the progress made in the last decades in the understanding of a growing number of genetic and molecular causes of central nervous diseases, therapies that are effective to diminish or halt neuronal dysfunction/death are rare. Given the genetic complexity responsible for neurological disorders, the development of neuroprotective strategies seeking to preserve mitochondrial homeostasis is a realistic challenge to lastingly diminish the harmful evolution of these pathologies and so to recover quality of life. A promising candidate is the neuroglobin, a globin superfamily member of 151 amino acids, which is found at high levels in the brain, the eye, and the cerebellum. The protein, which localizes to mitochondria, is involved in electron transfer, oxygen storage and defence against oxidative stress; hence, possessing neuroprotective properties. This review surveys up-to-date knowledge and emphasizes on existing investigations regarding neuroglobin physiological functions, which remain since its discovery in 2000 under intense debate and the possibility of using neuroglobin either by gene therapy or its direct delivery into the brain to treat neurological disorders. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010869670

Recent advances in research have highlighted the important therapeutic potential of Tregs in neurological diseases and tissue repair, emphasizing their multifaceted roles in immune regulation. This review aims to summarize and analyze the mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential of Tregs in relation to neurological diseases and neural regeneration. Beyond their classical immune-regulatory functions, emerging evidence points to non-immune mechanisms of regulatory T cells, particularly their interactions with stem cells and other non-immune cells. These interactions contribute to optimizing the repair microenvironment and promoting tissue repair and nerve regeneration, positioning non-immune pathways as a promising direction for future research. By modulating immune and non-immune cells, including neurons and glia within neural tissues, Tregs have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in enhancing regeneration in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Preclinical studies have revealed that Treg cells interact with neurons, glial cells, and other neural components to mitigate inflammatory damage and support functional recovery. Current mechanistic studies show that Tregs can significantly promote neural repair and functional recovery by regulating inflammatory responses and the local immune microenvironment. However, research on the mechanistic roles of regulatory T cells in other diseases remains limited, highlighting substantial gaps and opportunities for exploration in this field. Laboratory and clinical studies have further advanced the application of regulatory T cells. Technical advances have enabled efficient isolation, ex vivo expansion and functionalization, and adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells, with efficacy validated in animal models. Innovative strategies, including gene editing, cell-free technologies, biomaterial-based recruitment, and in situ delivery have expanded the therapeutic potential of regulatory T cells. Gene editing enables precise functional optimization, while biomaterial and in situ delivery technologies enhance their accumulation and efficacy at target sites. These advancements not only improve the immune-regulatory capacity of regulatory T cells but also significantly enhance their role in tissue repair. By leveraging the pivotal and diverse functions of Tregs in immune modulation and tissue repair, regulatory T cells–based therapies may lead to transformative breakthroughs in the treatment of neurological diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010844481

However, if the unfolded protein response fails to restore endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, it can trigger pro-inflammatory and pro-death signals, which are implicated in various malignancies and are currently being investigated for their role in retinal degenerative diseases. This paper reviews the role of the unfolded protein responsein addressing endoplasmic reticulumstress in retinal degenerative diseases. The accumulation of ubiquitylated misfolded proteins can lead to rapid destabilization of the proteome and cellular demise. Targeting endoplasmic reticulum stress to alleviate retinal pathologies involves multiple strategies, including the use of chemical chaperones such as 4-phenylbutyric acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid, which enhance protein folding and reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress. Small molecule modulators that influence endoplasmic reticulum stress sensors, including those that increase the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress regulator X-box binding protein 1, are also potential therapeutic agents. Additionally, inhibitors of the RNAse activity of inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1, a key endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor, represent another class of drugs that could prevent the formation of toxic aggregates. The activation of nuclear receptors, such as PPAR and FXR, may also help mitigate ER stress. Furthermore, enhancing proteolysis through the induction of autophagy or the inhibition of deubiquitinating enzymes can assist in clearing misfolded proteins. Combination treatments that involve endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-targeting drugs and gene therapies are also being explored. Despite these potential therapeutic strategies, significant challenges remain in targeting endoplasmic reticulum stress for the treatment of retinal degeneration, and further research is essential to elucidate the mechanisms underlying human retinal diseases and to develop effective, well-tolerated drugs. The use of existing drugs that target inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1 and X-box binding protein 1 has been associated with adverse side effects, which have hindered their clinical translation. Moreover, signaling pathways downstream of endoplasmic reticulum stress sensors can contribute to therapy resistance. Addressing these limitations is crucial for developing drugs that can be effectively used in treating retinal dystrophies. In conclusion, while the unfolded protein response is a promising therapeutic target in retinal degenerative diseases, additional research and development efforts are imperative to overcome the current limitations and improve patient outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010837697

Kinesins contribute to nerve regeneration through the transport of specific cargo, such as proteins and membrane components, from the cell body towards the axon periphery. We show here that KIF4A, associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and previously believed to be only expressed during development, is also expressed in the adult vertebrate nervous system and up-regulated in injured peripheral nervous system cells. KIF4A is detected both in the cell bodies and regrowing axons of injured neurons, consistent with its function as an axonal transporter of cargoes such as β1-integrin and L1CAM. Our study further demonstrates that KIF4A levels are greatly increased in Schwann cells from injured distal nerve stumps, particularly at a time when they are reprogrammed into an essential proliferative repair phenotype. Moreover, Kif4a mRNA levels were approximately ~6-fold higher in proliferative cultured Schwann cells compared with non-proliferative ones. A hypothesized function for Kif4a in Schwann cell proliferation was further confirmed by Kif4a knockdown, as this significantly reduced Schwann cell proliferation in vitro. Our findings show that KIF4A is expressed in adult vertebrate nervous systems and is up-regulated following peripheral injury. The timing of KIF4A up-regulation, its location during regeneration, and its proliferative role, all suggest a dual role for this protein in neuroregeneration that is worth exploring in the future. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010729370

Recently, stem cell technology has demonstrated remarkable therapeutic potential in addressing various neurological diseases, igniting interest in its applicability for epilepsy treatment. This comprehensive review summarizes different therapeutic approaches utilizing various types of stem cells. Preclinical experiments have explored the use and potential therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells, including genetically modified variants. Clinical trials involving patient-derived mesenchymal stem cells have shown promising results, with reductions in the frequency of epileptic seizures and improvements in neurological, cognitive, and motor functions reported. Another promising therapeutic strategy involves neural stem cells. These cells can be cultured outside the body and directed to differentiate into specific cell types. The transplant of neural stem cells has the potential to replace lost inhibitory interneurons, providing a novel treatment avenue for epilepsy. Embryonic stem cells are characterized by their significant capacity for self-renewal and their ability to differentiate into any type of somatic cell. In epilepsy treatment, embryonic stem cells can serve three primary functions: neuron regeneration, the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and restorative activity. One notable strategy involves differentiating embryonic stem cells into γ-aminobutyric acidergic neurons for transplantation into lesion sites. This approach is currently undergoing clinical trials and could be a breakthrough in the treatment of refractory epilepsy. Induced pluripotent stem cells share the same genetic background as the donor, thereby reducing the risk of immune rejection and addressing ethical concerns. However, research on induced pluripotent stem cell therapy remains in the preclinical stage. Despite the promise of stem cell therapies for epilepsy, several limitations must be addressed. Safety concerns persist, including issues such as tumor formation, and the low survival rate of transplanted cells remains a significant challenge. Additionally, the high cost of these treatments may be prohibitive for some patients. In summary, stem cell therapy shows considerable promise in managing epilepsy, but further research is needed to overcome its existing limitations and enhance its clinical applicability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010682937

Pericytes play a vital role in nervous system development, significantly influencing the formation, maturation, and maintenance of the central nervous system. An expanding body of studies has revealed that pericytes establish carefully regulated interactions with oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes. These communications govern numerous critical brain processes, including angiogenesis, neurovascular unit homeostasis, blood-brain barrier integrity, cerebral blood flow regulation, and immune response initiation. Glial cells and pericytes participate in dynamic and reciprocal interactions, with each influencing and adjusting the functionality of the other. Pericytes have the ability to control astrocyte polarization, trigger differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and initiate immunological responses in microglia. Various neurological disorders that compromise the integrity of the blood-brain barrier can disrupt these communications, impair waste clearance, and hinder cerebral blood circulation, contributing to neuroinflammation. In the context of neurodegeneration, these disruptions exacerbate pathological processes, such as neuronal damage, synaptic dysfunction, and impaired tissue repair. This article explores the complex interactions between pericytes and various glial cells in both healthy and pathological states of the central nervous system.

Extracellular vesicles are nanosized lipid-bilayer vesicles secreted by cells that play a crucial role in intercellular communication due to their diverse cargo. Among these, brain-derived extracellular vesicles, which are secreted by various brain cells such as neurons, glial cells, and Schwann cells, have garnered increasing attention. They serve as a promising tool for elucidating Parkinson's disease pathogenesis and for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This review highlights the recent advancements in our understanding of brain-derived extracellular vesicles released into the blood and their role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, with specific emphasis on their involvement in the aggregation and spread of alpha-synuclein. Brain-derived extracellular vesicles contribute to disease progression through multiple mechanisms, including autophagy-lysosome dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress, collectively driving neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Their application in Parkinson's disease diagnosis is a primary focus of this review. Recent studies have demonstrated that brain-derived extracellular vesicles can be isolated from peripheral blood samples, as they carry α-synuclein and other key biomarkers such as DJ-1 and various microRNAs. These findings highlight the potential of brain-derived extracellular vesicles, not only for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease but also for disease progression monitoring and differential diagnosis. Additionally, an overview of explorations into the potential therapeutic applications of brain-derived extracellular vesicles for Parkinson's disease is provided. Therapeutic strategies targeting brain-derived extracellular vesicles involve modulating the release and uptake of pathological alpha-synuclein -containing brain-derived extracellular vesicles to inhibit the spread of the protein. Moreover, brain-derived extracellular vesicles show immense promise as therapeutic delivery vehicles capable of transporting drugs into the central nervous system. Importantly, brain-derived extracellular vesicles also play a crucial role in neural regeneration by promoting neuronal protection, supporting axonal regeneration, and facilitating myelin repair, further enhancing their therapeutic potential in Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders. Further clarification is needed of the methods for identifying and extracting brain-derived extracellular vesicles, and large-scale cohort studies are necessary to validate the accuracy and specificity of these biomarkers. Future research should focus on systematically elucidating the unique mechanistic roles of brain-derived extracellular vesicles, as well as their distinct advantages in the clinical translation of methods for early detection and therapeutic development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010630536

Abnormal mitophagy may contribute significantly to secondary spinal cord injury, leading to the impaired production of adenosine triphosphate, ion imbalance, the excessive production of reactive oxygen species, neuroinflammation, and neuronal cell death. Therefore, maintaining an appropriate balance of mitophagy is crucial when treating spinal cord injury, as both excessive and insufficient mitophagy can impede recovery. In this review, we summarize the pathological changes associated with spinal cord injury, the mechanisms of mitophagy, and the direct and indirect relationships between mitophagy and spinal cord injury. We also consider therapeutic approaches that target mitophagy for the treatment of spinal cord injury, including ongoing clinical trials and other innovative therapies, such as use of stem cells, nanomaterials, and small molecule polymers.

The injury and loss of retinal ganglion cells are the primary pathological changes in several retinal degenerative diseases, including glaucoma, ischemic optic neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, and optic neuritis. In mammals, injured retinal ganglion cells lack regenerative capacity and undergo apoptotic cell death within a few days of injury. Additionally, these cells exhibit limited regenerative ability, ultimately contributing to vision impairment and potentially leading to blindness. Currently, the only effective clinical treatment for glaucoma is to prevent vision loss by lowering intraocular pressure through medications or surgery; however, this approach cannot halt the effect of retinal ganglion cell loss on visual function. This review comprehensively investigates the mechanisms underlying retinal ganglion cell degeneration in retinal degenerative diseases and further explores the current status and potential of cell replacement therapy for regenerating retinal ganglion cells.

After ischemic stroke, both astrocytes and the blood-brain barrier undergo morphological and functional transformations. However, the interplay between astrocytes and the blood-brain barrier has received less attention. This comprehensive review explores the physiological and pathological morphological and functional changes in astrocytes and the blood-brain barrier in ischemic stroke. Post-stroke, the structure of endothelial cells and peripheral cells undergoes alterations, causing disruption of the blood-brain barrier. This disruption allows various pro-inflammatory factors and chemokines to cross the blood-brain barrier. Simultaneously, astrocytes swell and primarily adopt two phenotypic states: A1 and A2, which exhibit different roles at different stages of ischemic stroke. During the acute phase, A1 reactive astrocytes secrete vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinases, lipid carrier protein-2, and other cytokines, exacerbating damage to endothelial cells and tight junctions. Conversely, A2 reactive astrocytes produce pentraxin 3, Sonic hedgehog, angiopoietin-1, and other protective factors for endothelial cells. Furthermore, astrocytes indirectly influence blood-brain barrier permeability through ferroptosis and exosomes. In the middle and late (recovery) stages of ischemic stroke, A1 and A2 astrocytes show different effects on glial scar formation. A1 astrocytes promote glial scar formation and inhibit axon growth via glial fibrillary acidic protein, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and transforming growth factor-β. In contrast, A2 astrocytes facilitate axon growth through platelet-derived growth factor, playing a crucial role in vascular remodeling. Therefore, enhancing our understanding of the pathological changes and interactions between astrocytes and the blood-brain barrier is a vital therapeutic target for preventing further brain damage in acute stroke. These insights may pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies for ischemic stroke. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010596128

Stroke is a life-threatening cerebrovascular condition characterized by intricate pathophysiological mechanisms, including oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal injury. Critical transcription factors, such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and nuclear factor kappa B, play central roles in the progression of stroke. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 is sensitive to changes in the cellular redox status and is crucial in protecting cells against oxidative damage, inflammatory responses, and cytotoxic agents. It plays a significant role in post-stroke neuroprotection and repair by influencing mitochondrial function, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and lysosomal activity and regulating metabolic pathways and cytokine expression. Conversely, nuclear factor-kappaB is closely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, the generation of reactive oxygen species, oxidative stress exacerbation, and inflammation. Nuclear factor-kappaB contributes to neuronal injury, apoptosis, and immune responses following stroke by modulating cell adhesion molecules and inflammatory mediators. The interplay between these pathways, potentially involving crosstalk among various organelles, significantly influences stroke pathophysiology. Advancements in single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics have greatly improved our understanding of stroke pathogenesis and offer new opportunities for the development of targeted, individualized, cell type-specific treatments.

The abnormal buildup of myelin debris at sites of injury greatly impedes nerve regeneration, making the clearance of debris within these microenvironments crucial for effective post-spinal cord injury repair. In this review, we comprehensively outline the mechanisms that promote the clearance of myelin debris and myelin metabolism and summarize their roles in spinal cord injury. First, we describe the composition and characteristics of myelin debris and explain its effects on the injury site. Next, we introduce the phagocytic cells involved in myelin debris clearance, including professional phagocytes (macrophages and microglia) and non-professional phagocytes (astrocytes and microvascular endothelial cells), as well as other cells that are also proposed to participate in phagocytosis. Finally, we focus on the pathways and associated targets that enhance myelin debris clearance by phagocytes and promote lipid metabolism following spinal cord injury. Our analysis indicates that myelin debris phagocytosis is not limited to monocyte-derived macrophages, but also involves microglia, astrocytes, and microvascular endothelial cells. By modulating the expression of genes related to phagocytosis and lipid metabolism, it is possible to modulate lipid metabolism disorders and influence inflammatory phenotypes, ultimately affecting the recovery of motor function following spinal cord injury. Additionally, therapies such as targeted mitochondrial transplantation in phagocytic cells, exosome therapy, and repeated trans-spinal magnetic stimulation can effectively enhance the removal of myelin debris, presenting promising potential for future applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010487869

Diabetes mellitus (DM) patients are susceptible to developing SCs dysfunction and impairing bone healing. Rare research considered reconstructing mesenchymal stem cell-schwann cell circuitry in diabetic bone regeneration. Here we found that SCs in diabetic microenvironment appeared cellular senescence phenotype with excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial dysfunction. To target at senescent SCs, we co-entrapped small interfering RNA that targets P53 (Si–P53) and metformin (MET) in ZIF-8-based nanoparticles (MMZ@Si–P53). Mechanistically, MMZ@Si–P53 affected senescent SCs by promoting mitochondria recovery and serine biosynthesis. In addition, rejuvenation of SCs and recovery of mesenchymal stem cell-schwann cell circuitry inhibited bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) senescence and improved BMSCs ossification. Subsequently MMZ@Si–P53 loaded into glucose-responsive hydrogel system (MMZ@Si–P53/HAMA-PBA-PVA) for triggering release of nanoparticles in hyperglycemia. MMZ@Si–P53/HAMA-PBA-PVA strongly promoted diabetic bone regeneration in diabetic rat model.

The inhibition of p38 activation in ischemic myocardium can reduce ventricular muscle remodeling post-MI. However, owing to the dynamic change of p38 in ischemic myocardium after MI, the clinical therapeutic effect of p38 inhibitors is insufficient. Herein, we describe the design of a hydrogelator Nap-Phe-Phe-Thr-Gly-Tyr-OH (Nap-TGY) to coassemble the p38 inhibitor SB202190 (SB), a p38 responsive supramolecular hydrogel (Gel Nap-TGY + SB) for local administration and p38 responsive release of SB to efficiently improve the inflammatory microenvironment. Under the overexpression of p38 in ischemic myocardium, Nap-TGY in the hydrogel is phosphorylated to yield hydrophilic Nap-Phe-Phe-Thr(H2PO3)-Gly-Tyr(H2PO3) (Nap-TpGYp), triggering the disassembly of the hydrogel and a responsive release of the inhibitor. Intramyocardial hydrogel injection significant reducing p38 activation, ROS levels, and inflammation while promoting macrophage reprogramming and angiogenesis.

Current evidences showed that Piezo1 functions as a mechanotransducer and amplifier of inflammation across joint disorders including osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). In OA, Piezo1 mediates chondrocyte apoptosis and matrix degradation via calcium influx, NF-κB/MAPK activation, and ferroptosis, forming a feedback loop with IL-1α to exacerbate inflammation. In AS, Piezo1 drives pathological new bone formation through CaMKII signaling, synergizing with TNF-α/IL-17A to perpetuate entheseal inflammation. In IVDD, Piezo1-induced calcium dysregulation triggers mitochondrial dysfunction, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and YAP/TAZ-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, creating a self-amplifying cycle of mechanical stress and inflammation. Targeting Piezo1 emerges as a potential therapeutic strategy, with preclinical studies demonstrating inhibition of Piezo1 alleviates disease progression by disrupting mechanotransduction-inflammation crosstalk. However, challenges remain in achieving tissue-specific modulation. Future research should focus on elucidating Piezo1's context and developing precision therapeutics to restore mechanobiological balance in joint diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Short survey,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014167939

Because astrocytes dynamically react to the microenvironment and contribute to the neuroinflammatory process, they are well situated as initiators and/or targets for biomaterial-based immunomodulation strategies. To achieve this, we devised and validated an alginate hydrogel encapsulation approach using human pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes that enabled a novel coculture system with organoids composed of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. Encapsulated human astrocytes were able to secrete proteins to the external environment and become reactive in response to stimuli. When engineered to express the clinically relevant cytokine interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), astrocytes reduced organoid reactivity to inflammatory cytokines in both direct and indirect co-cultures. Furthermore, astrocytes engineered for regulated cytokine production through NFκB-mediated expression of an internal reporter (luciferase) or IL-1Ra demonstrated dose-dependent responsive behavior to a panel of stimuli. Encapsulated astrocytes were also able to be stably implanted into the rodent brain while secreting IL-1Ra. Altogether, these studies clarify human astrocyte inflammatory reactivity, deliver a novel coculture platform to test neuroinflammatory modulators in vitro, and demonstrate an implantation approach to provide astrocyte-derived proteins to the nervous system in vivo. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014099606

However, research on cultured meat, especially its lipo-nutritional values, such as the contents of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and cholesterol, remains unexplored. In this study, we propose a novel strategy for efficiently producing nutritionally optimized cultured fat with enhanced lipo-nutritional properties using food-grade hydrogels. First, we engineered an edible konjac glucomannan/alginate (KA) scaffold with aligned porous microstructures and adjustable mechanical properties via dual cross-linking of konjac glucomannan (KGM), alginate (Alg), and Ca2+. The biocompatible KA hydrogel exhibited excellent performance in supporting proliferation and differentiation of subcutaneous pre-adipocytes (SAT) and fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Notably, FAPs-derived cultured fat exhibited significantly enhanced lipo-nutritional quality compared to SAT-derived fat, characterized by an improved N6/N3 fatty acid ratio and elevated PUFA levels. Furthermore, we developed a biofunctionalized KPC scaffold by incorporating nano-phosphatidylcholine (nano-PC) into the KA hydrogel, which enhanced adipogenic differentiation. Cultured fat produced with the KPC scaffold showed increased fat and protein deposition, while reducing the cholesterol level by approximately 20 %. Our findings provide an innovative strategy producing cultured meat with superior lipo-nutritional quality, expanding the potential of food hydrogels in safe and sustainable cultured meat production. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014028549

Volumetric muscle loss (VML) severely disrupts the vascular niche and impairs the ability of MuSCs to regenerate functional skeletal muscle. Until now, it remains a great challenge to reconstruct the vascular niche for muscle regeneration. Here, we successfully developed a specific 3D induction strategy based on collagen matrix and pro-angiogenic culture system to fabricate a multifunctional human pre-vascularized microtissue (h-VM) in vitro. The h-VM featured a robust vascular network formed by endothelial cells, with pericytes and mesenchymal stem cells accompanying. Under a specific induction medium, the h-VM could differentiate into adipogenic and osteogenic tissues, indicating a strong stemness within the microtissue. Of note, the h-VM significantly boosted the myogenic differentiation of MuSCs through paracrine signaling. Transplantation of the h-VM into the volumetric muscle defect not only facilitated early vessel integration with the host vasculature but also maintained muscle structural stability and provided sustained mechanical support to the defect site. Mechanistically, the h-VM effectively induced MuSCs differentiation and myofiber formation, and M2 macrophage polarization, thereby mitigating muscle fibrosis and atrophy post-injury, ultimately achieving structural and functional angio-myogenesis. Our results highlight that the h-VM can effectively re-establish the vascular regenerative microenvironment, which presents an innovative therapeutic approach to promote functional skeletal muscle regeneration following volumetric muscle loss. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013841653

It occurs due to the occlusion of the cerebral arteries, which significantly reduces the delivery of blood, oxygen, and essential nutrients to brain tissues. This deprivation triggers a cascade of cellular events that ultimately leads to neuronal death. Recent studies have clarified the multifactorial pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, highlighting the roles of energy failure, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive insight into the fundamental mechanisms driving neuronal death triggered by ischemia and to examine the progress of neuroprotective therapeutic approaches designed to mitigate neuronal loss and promote neurological recovery after a stroke. Additionally, we explored widely accepted findings regarding the potential pathways implicated in neuronal death during ischemic stroke, including the interplay of apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and necrosis, which collectively influence neuronal fate. We also discussed advancements in neuroprotective therapeutics, encompassing a range of interventions from pharmacological modulation to stem cell-based therapies, aimed at reducing neuronal injury and enhancing functional recovery following ischemic stroke. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in translating mechanistic insights into effective clinical therapies. Although neuroprotective strategies have shown promise in preclinical models, their efficacy in human trials has been inconsistent, often due to the complex pathology of ischemic stroke and the timing of interventions. In conclusion, this review synthesizes mechanistic insights into the intricate interplay of molecular and cellular pathways driving neuronal death post-ischemia. It sheds light on cutting-edge advancements in potential neuroprotective therapeutics, underscores the promise of regenerative medicine, and offers a forward-looking perspective on potential clinical breakthroughs.

Lipids play important roles in synapse formation, neurotransmitter release, and signal transmission, and dysregulation of lipid metabolism is closely associated with various neurodegenerative diseases. The complex roles of lipids in synaptic function and neurological diseases have recently garnered increasing attention, but their specific mechanisms remain to be fully understood. This review aims to explore how lipids regulate synaptic activity in the central nervous system, focusing on their roles in synapse formation, neurotransmitter release, and signal transmission. Additionally, it discusses the mechanisms by which glial cells modulate synaptic function through lipid regulation. This review shows that within the central nervous system, lipids are essential components of the cell membrane bilayer, playing critical roles in synaptic structure and function. They regulate presynaptic vesicular trafficking, postsynaptic signaling pathways, and glial-neuronal interactions. Cholesterol maintains membrane fluidity and promotes the formation of lipid rafts. Glycerophospholipids contribute to the structural integrity of synaptic membranes and are involved in the release of synaptic vesicles. Sphingolipids interact with synaptic receptors through various mechanisms to regulate their activity and are also involved in cellular processes such as inflammation and apoptosis. Fatty acids are vital for energy metabolism and the synthesis of signaling molecules. Abnormalities in lipid metabolism may lead to impairments in synaptic function, affecting information transmission between neurons and the overall health of the nervous system. Therapeutic strategies targeting lipid metabolism, particularly through cholesterol modulation, show promise for treating these conditions. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, dysregulation of lipid metabolism is closely linked to synaptic dysfunction. Therefore, lipids are not only key molecules in neural regeneration and synaptic repair but may also contribute to neurodegenerative pathology when metabolic dysregulation occurs. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms linking lipid metabolism to synaptic dysfunction and to develop targeted lipid therapies for neurological diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010957052

This meta-analysis and systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of electroacupuncture and explore its potential mechanisms in animal models of ischemic stroke. The PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and CINAHL databases were comprehensively searched up to May 1, 2024. This review included articles on preclinical investigations of the efficacy and mechanisms of electroacupuncture in treating ischemic stroke. Data from 70 eligible studies were analyzed in Stata 18.0, using a random-effects model to calculate the standardized mean difference (Hedge's g). The risk of bias was assessed using RevMan 5.4 software, and the quality of evidence was rated according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Subgroup analyses were conducted to test the consistency of the results and sensitivity analyses were used to assess their robustness. The quality assessment revealed that most studies adequately handled incomplete data and selective reporting. However, several methodological limitations were identified: only 4 studies demonstrated a low risk of allocation concealment, 26 achieved a low risk of outcome assessment bias, and 9 had a high risk of randomization bias. Additionally, there was an unclear risk regarding participant blinding and other methodological aspects. The GRADE assessment rated 12 outcomes as moderate quality and 6 as low quality. The mechanisms of electroacupuncture treatment for ischemic stroke can be categorized as five primary pathways: (1) Electroacupuncture significantly reduced infarct volume and apoptotic cell death (P < 0.01) in ischemic stroke models; (2) electroacupuncture significantly decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory factors (P < 0.01) while increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory factors (P = 0.02); (3) electroacupuncture reduced the levels of oxidative stress indicators (P < 0.01) and enhanced the expression of antioxidant enzymes (P < 0.01); (4) electroacupuncture significantly promoted nerve regeneration (P < 0.01); and (5) electroacupuncture influenced blood flow remodeling (P < 0.01) and angiogenesis (P < 0.01). Subgroup analyses indicated that electroacupuncture was most effective in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model (P < 0.01) and in post-middle cerebral artery occlusion intervention (P < 0.01). Dispersive waves were found to outperform continuous waves with respect to neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory effects (P < 0.01), while scalp acupoints demonstrated greater efficacy than body acupoints (P < 0.01). The heterogeneity among the included studies was minimal, and sensitivity analyses indicated stable results. Their methodological quality was generally satisfactory. In conclusion, electroacupuncture is effective in treating cerebral ischemia by modulating cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, stroke-induced nerve regeneration, blood flow remodeling, and angiogenesis. The efficacy of electroacupuncture may be influenced by factors such as the middle cerebral artery occlusion model, the timing of intervention onset, waveform, and acupoint selection. Despite the moderate to low quality of evidence, these findings suggest that electroacupuncture has clinical potential for improving outcomes in ischemic stroke. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010938065

However, current descriptions of these biological processes do not fully explain the onset, progression, and development of these conditions. Therefore, exploration of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases remains a valuable area of research. This review summarizes the potential common pathogeneses of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal lobar dementia, and Lewy body disease. Research findings have indicated that several common biological processes, including aging, genetic factors, progressive neuronal dysfunction, neuronal death and apoptosis, protein misfolding and aggregation, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, axonal transport defects, and gut microbiota dysbiosis, are involved in the pathogenesis of these six neurodegenerative diseases. Based on current information derived from diverse areas of research, these biological processes may form complex pathogenic networks that lead to distinctive types of neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, promoting the regeneration of damaged neurons may be achievable through the repair of affected neural cells if the underlying pathogenesis can be prevented or reversed. Hence, these potential common biological processes may represent only very small, limited elements within numerous intricate pathogenic networks associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In clinical treatment, interfering with any single biological process has proven insufficient to completely halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, future research on the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases should focus on uncovering the complex pathogenic networks, rather than isolating individual biological processes. Based on this, therapies that aim to block or reverse various targets involved in the potential pathogenic mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases may be promising directions, as current treatment methods that focus on halting a single pathogenic factor have not achieved satisfactory efficacy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010921997

Functional recovery is often hindered by constraints on the timing of interventions, combined with the limitations of current methods. To address these challenges, various techniques have been developed to aid in the repair and reconstruction of neural circuits at different stages of injury. Notably, neuromodulation has garnered considerable attention for its potential to enhance nerve regeneration, provide neuroprotection, restore neurons, and regulate the neural reorganization of circuits within the cerebral cortex and corticospinal tract. To improve the effectiveness of these interventions, the implementation of multi-target early interventional neuromodulation strategies, such as electrical and magnetic stimulation, is recommended to enhance functional recovery across different phases of nerve injury. This review concisely outlines the challenges encountered following spinal cord injury, synthesizes existing neurostimulation techniques while emphasizing neuroprotection, repair, and regeneration of impaired connections, and advocates for multi-targeted, task-oriented, and timely interventions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010921170

A deeper understanding of the changes in gene expression and the fundamental molecular mechanisms involved could help address this critical issue. In recent years, research into regulatory long non-coding (lnc)RNAs, a diverse group of RNA molecules with regulatory functions, has emerged as a promising direction in the study of cerebral infarction. This review paper aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of the roles of regulatory lncRNAs in cerebral infarction, as well as potential strategies for their application in clinical settings. LncRNAs have the potential to act as 'sponges' that attract specific microRNAs, thereby regulating the expression of microRNA target genes. These interactions influence various aspects of ischemic stroke, including reperfusion-induced damage, cell death, immune responses, autophagy, angiogenesis, and the generation of reactive oxygen species. We highlight several regulatory lncRNAs that have been utilized in animal model treatments, including lncRNA NKILA, lncRNA Meg8, and lncRNA H19. Additionally, we discuss lncRNAs that have been used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of cerebral infarction, such as lncRNA FOXO3, lncRNA XIST, and lncRNA RMST. The lncRNAs hold potential for genetic-level treatments in patients. However, numerous challenges, including inefficiency, low targeting accuracy, and side effects observed in preliminary studies, indicate the need for thorough investigation. The application of lncRNAs in ischemic stroke presents challenges that require careful and extensive validation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010781331

Patients often suffer from a secondary cascade of damage, including neuroinflammation, cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Regrettably, there is a paucity of clinically available therapeutics to address these issues. Emerging evidence underscores the pivotal roles of astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the brain, throughout the various stages of ischemic stroke. In this comprehensive review, we initially provide an overview of the fundamental physiological functions of astrocytes in the brain, emphasizing their critical role in modulating neuronal homeostasis, synaptic activity, and blood-brain barrier integrity. We then delve into the growing body of evidence that highlights the functional diversity and heterogeneity of astrocytes in the context of ischemic stroke. Their well-established contributions to energy provision, metabolic regulation, and neurotransmitter homeostasis, as well as their emerging roles in mitochondrial recovery, neuroinflammation regulation, and oxidative stress modulation following ischemic injury, are discussed in detail. We also explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms underpinning these functions, with particular emphasis on recently identified targets within astrocytes that offer promising prospects for therapeutic intervention. In the final section of this review, we offer a detailed overview of the current therapeutic strategies targeting astrocytes in the treatment of ischemic stroke. These astrocyte-targeting strategies are categorized into traditional small-molecule drugs, microRNAs (miRNAs), stem cell-based therapies, cellular reprogramming, hydrogels, and extracellular vesicles. By summarizing the current understanding of astrocyte functions and therapeutic targeting approaches, we aim to highlight the critical roles of astrocytes during and after stroke, particularly in the pathophysiological development in ischemic stroke. We also emphasize promising avenues for novel, astrocyte-targeted therapeutics that could become clinically available options, ultimately improving outcomes for patients with stroke. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010781039

This review systematically analyzes the current understanding of the bidirectional relationship between blood-brain barrier disruption and neuroinflammation in traumatic brain injury, along with emerging combination therapeutic strategies. Literature review indicates that blood-brain barrier disruption and neuroinflammatory responses are key pathological features following traumatic brain injury. In the acute phase after traumatic brain injury, the pathological characteristics include primary blood-brain barrier disruption and the activation of inflammatory cascades. In the subacute phase, the pathological features are characterized by repair mechanisms and inflammatory modulation. In the chronic phase, the pathological features show persistent low-grade inflammation and incomplete recovery of the blood-brain barrier. Various physiological changes, such as structural alterations of the blood-brain barrier, inflammatory cascades, and extracellular matrix remodeling, interact with each other and are influenced by genetic, age, sex, and environmental factors. The dynamic balance between blood-brain barrier permeability and neuroinflammation is regulated by hormones, particularly sex hormones and stress-related hormones. Additionally, the role of gastrointestinal hormones is receiving increasing attention. Current treatment strategies for traumatic brain injury include various methods such as conventional drug combinations, multimodality neuromonitoring, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and non-invasive brain stimulation. Artificial intelligence also shows potential in treatment decision-making and personalized therapy. Emerging sequential combination strategies and precision medicine approaches can help improve treatment outcomes; however, challenges remain, such as inadequate research on the mechanisms of the chronic phase traumatic brain injury and difficulties with technology integration. Future research on traumatic brain injury should focus on personalized treatment strategies, the standardization of techniques, cost-effectiveness evaluations, and addressing the needs of patients with comorbidities. A multidisciplinary approach should be used to enhance treatment and improve patient outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010716967

Here, we used a severe stroke rat model with 150 minutes of ischemia, which produced severe behavioral deficiencies that persisted at 12 weeks, to study the therapeutic effect of neural stem cells on neural restoration in chronic stroke. Our study showed that stroke model rats treated with human neural stem cells had long-term sustained recovery of motor function, reduced infarction volume, long-term human neural stem cell survival, and improved local inflammatory environment and angiogenesis. We also demonstrated that transplanted human neural stem cells differentiated into mature neurons in vivo, formed stable functional synaptic connections with host neurons, and exhibited the electrophysiological properties of functional mature neurons, indicating that they replaced the damaged host neurons. The findings showed that human fetal-derived neural stem cells had long-term effects for neurological recovery in a model of severe stroke, which suggests that human neural stem cells-based therapy may be effective for repairing damaged neural circuits in stroke patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010716343

Accordingly, recent evidence indicates that glaucoma is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system that causes damage throughout the visual pathway. However, the effects of glaucoma on synaptic plasticity in the primary visual cortex remain unclear. In this study, we established a mouse model of unilateral chronic ocular hypertension by injecting magnetic microbeads into the anterior chamber of one eye. We found that, after 4 weeks of chronic ocular hypertension, the neuronal somas were smaller in the superior colliculus and lateral geniculate body regions of the brain contralateral to the affected eye. This was accompanied by glial cell activation and increased expression of inflammatory factors. After 8 weeks of ocular hypertension, we observed a reduction in the number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, dendritic spines, and activation of glial cells in the primary visual cortex contralateral to the affected eye. These findings suggest that glaucoma not only directly damages the retina but also induces alterations in synapses and dendritic spines in the primary visual cortex, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of glaucoma. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010635952

This work presents magnetic-field-assisted solute partitioning in the pinning-controlled Sm-Co-Fe-Cu-Zr magnets to enhance coercivity without deteriorating remanence. As exhibited in a model commercially-sintered magnet Sm<inf>25</inf>Co<inf>44.9</inf>Fe<inf>21.5</inf>Cu<inf>5.6</inf>Zr<inf>3.0</inf> (wt.%), applying an external magnetic field during post-aging slow cooling process (defined as magnetic slow cooling, MSC) can effectively enhance coercivity H<inf>cj</inf> from 18.50 kOe for the magnet with conventional Non-MSC processing to 21.30 kOe, well retaining the remanence B<inf>r</inf> above 11.6 kG. Detailed microstructural and microchemical investigations revealed that MSC accelerates solute partitioning between rhombohedral Sm<inf>2</inf>Co<inf>17</inf> (2:17R) nanocells and hexagonal SmCo<inf>5</inf> (1:5H) cell boundaries, by enriching Fe/Co contents inside the former that improves its saturation magnetization and enriching Cu content inside the later that strengthens the pinning force to hinder domain wall motions. In addition, MSC can also effectively reduce the cell-edge 2:17R’ phase (alternatively an incompletely-decomposed product with one faulted basal layer in 2:17R lattice, or an intermediate phase of 2:17R equilibrium phase) that was harmful for both remanence and coercivity. Thermodynamically, the beneficial role played by MSC can be attributed to the associated magnetostatic energy, which provides an extra driving force to promote phase transition and solute partitioning. Further study has shown that optimizing MSC cooling rate can further enhance H<inf>cj</inf> to 23.30 kOe without deteriorating B<inf>r</inf>, demonstrating that the magnetic-field-assisted solute partitioning method is effective to overcoming the remanence-coercivity trade-off in 2:17-type Sm-Co magnets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009278886

OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the causal relationship between lipids and osteoporotic pathological fractures using a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis. METHODS: The data for 178 lipid metabolites were obtained from the IEU-GWAS database (developed by the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol, UK, which provides extensive summary data from genome-wide association studies), while osteoporotic pathological fracture data (from 173 619 European participants) were acquired from the FinnGen database (constructed by the Finnish national gene research program, focusing on investigating relationships between genomics and health/disease in the Finnish population). Osteoporotic pathological fracture data were used as the outcome variable, with lipids serving as exposures, for the bidirectional Mendelian randomization study to evaluate the causal effects of different lipids on osteoporotic pathological fractures. The UK Biobank database was employed as a validation set by switching the outcome variable to verify the findings horizontally. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) The inverse variance weighted analysis indicated that each unit increase in sterol ester (27:1/20:2) levels was associated with a 25.55% increase in the risk of osteoporotic pathological fractures (odds ratio=1.256, 95% confidence interval: 1.001-1.575, P = 0.049), suggesting a significant positive correlation between elevated sterol ester levels and increased fracture risk. Reverse Mendelian randomization analysis revealed a significant negative association between osteoporotic pathological fractures and three types of phosphatidylcholine. Horizontal validation yielded consistent results, confirming sterol ester as a risk factor for osteoporotic pathological fractures. (2) The results indicate that sterol ester is a risk factor for osteoporotic pathological fractures, while phosphatidylcholine serves as a protective factor. These findings strengthen the evidence supporting the effect of lipids on the risk of osteoporotic pathological fractures. Although the GWAS data used in this study were derived from European populations, given the broad commonality of human genetics, the results provide valuable reference significance for improving osteoporosis in Chinese populations through lipid regulation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010859252

Traditional treatment methods are not ideal and have limitations. As an emerging discipline, tissue engineering has opened up a new path for the treatment of oral submucous fibrosis. OBJECTIVE: To review the latest progress in the pathogenesis and treatment of oral submucous fibrosis, and to summarize and analyze the role and research progress of mesenchymal stem cells, bioscaffold materials, and tissue-engineered oral mucosa in oral submucous fibrosis, thereby providing ideas for the research and clinical application of tissue engineering in the treatment of oral submucous fibrosis.

A total of 166 articles were finally included for analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) The pathogenesis of oral submucous fibrosis is complex, and many factors are closely related to oral submucous fibrosis, but ultimately they promote the development of oral submucous fibrosis by promoting collagen deposition and accelerating fibroblast proliferation. (2) Traditional treatment methods for oral submucous fibrosis have problems such as low patient compliance and unsatisfactory results, and new treatment strategies are urgently needed. (3) Mesenchymal stem cells regulate the pathological microenvironment, reduce inflammation and inhibit the process of fibrosis due to their immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties, providing a new idea for the treatment of oral submucous fibrosis. (4) Biomass materials, as drug and cell delivery carriers, regulate the pathological microenvironment and are used in various fibrotic diseases, providing a new solution for the treatment of oral submucous fibrosis. (5) Tissue-engineered oral mucosa can be used as an autologous mucosa substitute to promote tissue repair, and also provides a basis for the establishment of disease models.

In earlier clinical observations, it is discovered that using Guilu Erxian Glue to treat patients with liver-kidney deficiency type knee osteoarthritis effectively alleviated knee pain, increased the range of motion, and improved walking ability. However, the exact mechanism by which oral administration of Guilu Erxian Glue can produce local therapeutic effects on the knee joint is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Guilu Erxian Glue on gut microbiota in rats with knee osteoarthritis and to evaluate its mechanism using 16S rDNA sequencing and machine learning analysis. METHODS: Totally 18 female SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: blank group, model group, and Guilu Erxian Glue group, with 8 rats in each group. A knee osteoarthritis model was prepared using the destabilization of the medial meniscus surgical method. After successful modeling, the Guilu Erxian Glue group was given a decoction of Guilu Erxian Glue by gavage, while the blank and model groups were given an equal amount of distilled water. After 28 days of continuous intervention, high performance liquid chromatography was used to detect the active ingredients of Guilu Erxian Glue. MRI imaging was used to observe the condition of rat knee articular cartilage. Fecal samples were collected; DNA was extracted using a kit, amplified and purified by PCR, and an Illumina sequencing library was constructed. The Illumina MiSeq platform was used for high-throughput sequencing to generate raw sequence data. After obtaining the raw data, QIIME2 software was used to process the data. Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size analysis and random forest algorithm were used to screen for differential species in microbial data. KEGG and MetaCyc functional pathway analyses were used to explore the association between key microbial communities and experimental groups. Linear discriminant analysis effect values and random forest algorithm were used to screen for differential species. Association networks were used to analyze the interactions between microbial communities, and machine learning methods were used to analyze the composition and changes of gut microbiota. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) LC-MS component identification was conducted on the traditional Chinese medicine formula of Guilu Erxian Glue, and a total of 7 effective ingredients were identified. (2) MRI imaging showed that synovitis scope of high-density shadows in rats of the Guilu Erxian Glue group was reduced, and the degeneration of medial femoral condyle cartilage was less than that in the model group. (3) 16S rDNA sequencing showed that the model group rats exhibited significant microbial imbalance, with a significant decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes at the phylum level, while the proportion of Proteobacteria increased significantly (P < 0.05). The gut microbiota structure of rats in the Guilu Erxian Glue group was significantly improved, and the proportion of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes increased, restoring a more diverse microbiota composition, approaching that of the blank group (P < 0.05). (4) KEGG and MetaCyc functional pathway analysis showed that the Guilu Erxian Glue group significantly activated multiple metabolic pathways, including amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and biotin synthesis pathways (P < 0.05). (5) The results indicate that Guilu Erxian Glue contains seven active ingredients, and the changes in gut microbiota of knee osteoarthritis rats were analyzed using 16S rDNA sequencing. Guilu Erxian Glue can significantly improve the imbalance of gut microbiota, restore the abundance of beneficial bacteria, and have a significant impact on the composition of gut microbiota, providing scientific basis for the efficacy and mechanism of Guilu Erxian Glue. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008943002

Bone generates electrical potentials through the piezoelectric properties of collagen fibrils and apatite minerals under mechanical loading. These electrical signals influence osteoconductivity and regenerative capacity by osteogenic cells. Synthetic ceramic biomaterials can be electrically polarized to mimic bone's natural electroactivity. Polarization improves surface wettability of biomaterial surfaces by increasing surface free energy, promoting serum protein adsorption and osteoblast adhesion while also influencing osteoclast differentiation. These surface modifications by polarization can be achieved without changing surface morphology or crystallinity and offer stable and long-lasting bioactivity at biointerface. This review details the physicochemical mechanisms underlying polarization, protein interaction, and cellular responses at biointerface.

Current deep learning-based tinnitus diagnosis methods face two key challenges: difficulty in extracting high-dimensional tinnitus-related features from non-stationary and low signal to noise ratio(SNR) EEG signals, and vulnerability to noisy labels in training data. To address these, we propose XTinnitusNet, a multi-view graph robust model ensemble. It integrates a Graph Attention Neural Network (GANN) for analyzing brain functional connectivity features and a Multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN) for extracting multi-scale time-series features. This dual-component architecture enhances the model's ability to capture complex EEG patterns. Additionally, the co-teaching plus mechanism is incorporated into the training process, enabling cross-updating between the MSCNN and GANN components using disagreement data with minimal loss. We evaluated the EEG data of 24 tinnitus patients and 24 healthy subjects using a five-fold cross-validation strategy, with metrics including area under the curve (AUC) and expected calibration error (ECE). Results show XTinnitusNet outperforms baseline models in diagnostic accuracy and robustness across different noise levels. Specifically, it achieves an AUC of 88.33% at a noise rate of 0.1 and maintains a high AUC of 84.02% when the noise rate increases to 0.3. Feature interpretability analysis also shows that XTinnitusNet effectively extracts meaningful functional connectivity features from EEG signals, particularly in the left temporal and frontal cortices. This work provides a robust and interpretable framework for automated tinnitus diagnosis using EEG signals, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reliability even with noisy labels. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014941871

Building on prior findings that low-intensity (5 kV/cm) nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) can partially reprogram HDFs toward pluripotency and boost their osteogenic capacity, an in vivo bone regeneration complex was fabricated by encapsulating nsPEF-treated cells in a self-healing hydrogel composed of oxidized hyaluronic acid and hydroxypropyl chitosan. In nude mice, these HDFs produced more robust ectopic bone both subcutaneously and within cranial defects, with significantly higher histological scores than untreated controls. RNA sequencing linked this enhanced osteogenesis to activation of the p38 MAPK/YAP pathway and accelerated endochondral ossification, findings that were validated by Western blot, qPCR, and immunofluorescence.

We found that transduction of one transcription factor, ER71, was required for the efficient derivation of induced endothelial cells from EMSCs (MiECs). Addition of transforming growth factor-β inhibitor (SB431542), vascular endothelial growth factor, and ascorbic acid to the culture media enhanced the differentiation efficiency. After one week of the induction protocol, 75.4 ± 4.5 % of EMSCs were directly differentiated into ECs as defined by double-positivity for VE-cadherin/PECAM1. MiECs demonstrated endothelial characteristics and functions. Interestingly, the immune tolerance of MSCs was potentiated in MiECs, and were mediated by IKAROS, a direct transcriptional target of ER71. We established an efficient protocol for direct differentiation of MSCs into functional ECs with immune tolerance properties based on ER71 transduction.

Engineering of culture platforms that mimic the physiological properties of the bone marrow (BM) in a scalable format is important to enable the translation of HSC therapies. Here, we report the design of biomimetic BM niches enabling the culture of HSCs in a scalable 3D platform. Beyond cellular and biochemical components (e.g. matrix and growth factors), an important element of the BM microenvironment is its architecture, dense in adipocytes, with relatively limited matrix and anisotropic mechanical properties. To capture this context, we propose the use of bioemulsions1,2 in which oil microdroplets and associated mechanical anisotropy recreate important architectural features of the hematopoietic niche. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) grown at the surface of bioemulsions assembled an interstitial matrix and secreted important factors critical to the maintenance of HSC phenotype. HSCs cultured in the resulting artificial BM niches maintained stemness whilst expanding significantly (>33-fold compared to suspension cultures) and enabling scale up of expansion in conical flask bioreactors (2 M cell batches).

These dental biomaterials selectively suppress pathogenic species such as Porphyromonas gingivalis while promoting commensal microbes. Bio-inspired design and artificial-intelligence-assisted material discovery are emerging as promising strategies. Ultimately, oral microbiome-modulating dental biomaterials can be leveraged to treat systemic diseases—including tumors and cardiovascular disorders—by promoting the saliva-mediated translocation of beneficial commensals.

Persistent inflammation and impaired cartilage repair accelerate the disease progression. The enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) contributes to OA by producing nitric oxide (NO), which intensifies inflammation and inhibits cartilage regeneration. Traditional iNOS inhibitors have demonstrated limited efficacy due to inadequate targeted release and uncoordinated control over inflammation. In this study, we developed a self-supported DNAzyme-based DNA hydrogel using rolling circle amplification (RCA) technology to deliver iNOS-targeting DNAzymes and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (BMSC-exos) in response to inflammation. The hydrogel incorporates triglycerol monostearate nanoparticles (TGMS NPs), which degrade under high matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels in OA joints, thereby triggering the release of the DNAzymes and exosomes with precision. This targeted delivery modulates the inflammatory microenvironment by reducing pro-inflammatory NO production and supports chondrogenesis by promoting M2 macrophage polarization. In vitro and in vivo analyses reveal that the hydrogel significantly reduces inflammatory cytokine levels, enhances chondrocyte proliferation, and restores extracellular matrix integrity, ultimately slowing OA progression. This smart hydrogel offers a promising ambidextrous strategy for microenvironment modulation and cartilage regeneration, potentially advancing OA treatment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012563251

However, little is known about how fibrosis is induced and regulated after cerebral ischemic injury. Sonic hedgehog signaling participates in fibrosis in the heart, liver, lung, and kidney. Whether Shh signaling modulates fibrotic scar formation after cerebral ischemic stroke and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we found that Sonic Hedgehog expression was upregulated in patients with acute ischemic stroke and in a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion injury rat model. Both Sonic hedgehog and Mitofusin 2 showed increased expression in the middle cerebral artery occlusion rat model and in vitro fibrosis cell model induced by transforming growth factor-beta 1. Activation of the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway enhanced the expression of phosphorylated Smad 3 and Mitofusin 2 proteins, promoted the formation of fibrotic scars, protected synapses or promoted synaptogenesis, alleviated neurological deficits following middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion injury, reduced cell apoptosis, facilitated the transformation of meninges fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, and enhanced the proliferation and migration of meninges fibroblasts. The Smad3 phosphorylation inhibitor SIS3 reversed the effects induced by Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway activation. Bioinformatics analysis revealed significant correlations between Sonic hedgehog and Smad3, between Sonic hedgehog and Mitofusin 2, and between Smad3 and Mitofusin 2. These findings suggest that Sonic hedgehog signaling may influence Mitofusin 2 expression by regulating Smad3 phosphorylation, thereby modulating the formation of early fibrotic scars following cerebral ischemic stroke and affecting prognosis.

This limited plasticity serves as a primary barrier to functional recovery after brain injury. Neuromodulation technologies represent one of the fastest-growing fields in medicine. These techniques utilize electricity, magnetism, sound, and light to restore or optimize brain functions by promoting reorganization or long-term changes that support functional recovery in patients with brain injury. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the effects and underlying mechanisms of neuromodulation technologies in supporting motor function recovery after brain injury. Many of these technologies are widely used in clinical practice and show significant improvements in motor function across various types of brain injury. However, studies report negative findings, potentially due to variations in stimulation protocols, differences in observation periods, and the severity of functional impairments among participants across different clinical trials. Additionally, we observed that different neuromodulation techniques share remarkably similar mechanisms, including promoting neuroplasticity, enhancing neurotrophic factor release, improving cerebral blood flow, suppressing neuroinflammation, and providing neuroprotection. Finally, considering the advantages and disadvantages of various neuromodulation techniques, we propose that future development should focus on closed-loop neural circuit stimulation, personalized treatment, interdisciplinary collaboration, and precision stimulation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012463743

In the context of orthopedic treatment, the osteointegration of titanium implant is largely affected by MSC aging, imposing considerable limitations on its long-term application. In this study, a surface modification on titanium implants was designed to enhance osteointegration by effectively regulating the functions of senescent MSC: A typical micro-nano topological structure was established on the implant surface to improve the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Then a functional hydrogel coating was covalently modified to the implant surface through a poly-dopamine layer. For senescent MSCs, firstly, the coating can eliminate the activation of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of senescent MSCs by micro-nano topological structure, and it accelerated the proliferation of non-senescent MSCs by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. With the degradation of the hydrogel coating, the composition of stem cell pool around the implant interfaces gradually rejuvenated, as the number of non-senescent MSCs increased and senescent MSCs decreased. Meanwhile, the exposed micro-nano topological structure showed significant effect on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, and ultimately promoted the osteointegration in aging rats. These results provided promising insights for the design and application of orthopedic titanium implants for aging patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012463559

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells regulate and interact with various cells in the retinal microenvironment by secreting neurotrophic factors and extracellular vesicles. Small extracellular vesicles derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, which offer low immunogenicity, minimal tumorigenic risk, and ease of transportation, have been utilized in the treatment of various neurological diseases. These vesicles exhibit various activities, including anti-inflammatory actions, promotion of tissue repair, and immune regulation. Therefore, novel strategies using human retinal progenitor cells combined with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles may represent an innovation in stem cell therapy for retinal degeneration. In this study, we developed such an approach utilizing retinal progenitor cells combined with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles to treat retinal degeneration in Royal College of Surgeons rats, a genetic model of retinal degeneration. Our findings revealed that the combination of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles and retinal progenitor cells significantly improved visual function in these rats. The addition of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles as adjuvants to stem cell transplantation with retinal progenitor cells enhanced the survival, migration, and differentiation of the exogenous retinal progenitor cells. Concurrently, these small extracellular vesicles inhibited the activation of regional microglia, promoted the migration of transplanted retinal progenitor cells to the inner nuclear layer of the retina, and facilitated their differentiation into photoreceptors and bipolar cells. These findings suggest that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles potentiate the therapeutic efficacy of retinal progenitor cells in retinal degeneration by promoting their survival and differentiation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012446161

One option is to stimulate endogenous neurogenesis in the subventricular zone and direct the newly formed neurons to the damaged area. However, only a small percentage of these neurons survive, and many do not reach the damaged area, possibly because the corpus callosum impedes the migration of subventricular zone-derived stem cells into the lesioned cortex. A second major obstacle to stem cell therapy is the strong inflammatory reaction induced by cerebral ischemia, whereby the associated phagocytic activity of brain macrophages removes both therapeutic cells and/or cell-based drug carriers. To address these issues, neurogenesis was electrically stimulated in the subventricular zone, followed by isolation of proliferating cells, including newly formed neurons, which were subsequently mixed with a nutritional hydrogel. This mixture was then transferred to the stroke cavity of day 14 post-stroke mice. We found that the performance of the treated animals improved in behavioral tests, including novel object, open field, hole board, grooming, and 'time-to-feel' adhesive tape tests. Furthermore, immunostaining revealed that the stem cell marker nestin, the neuroepithelial marker Mash1, and the immature neuronal marker doublecortin-positive cells survived in the transplanted area for 2 weeks, possibly due to reduced phagocytic activity and supportive angiogenesis. These results clearly indicate that the transplantation of committed subventricular zone stem cells combined with a protective nutritional gel directly into the infarct cavity after the peak of stroke-induced neuroinflammation represents a feasible approach to improve neurorestoration after cerebral ischemia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012433097

Due to its diverse etiologies and complex pathological mechanisms, preventing and treating cerebral small vessel vasculopathy is challenging. Recent studies have shown that the glymphatic system plays a crucial role in interstitial solute clearance and the maintenance of brain homeostasis. Increasing evidence also suggests that dysfunction in glymphatic clearance is a key factor in the progression of cerebral small vessel disease. This review begins with a comprehensive introduction to the structure, function, and driving factors of the glymphatic system, highlighting its essential role in brain waste clearance. Afterwards, cerebral small vessel disease was reviewed from the perspective of the glymphatic system, after which the mechanisms underlying their correlation were summarized. Glymphatic dysfunction may lead to the accumulation of metabolic waste in the brain, thereby exacerbating the pathological processes associated with cerebral small vessel disease. The review also discussed the direct evidence of glymphatic dysfunction in patients and animal models exhibiting two subtypes of cerebral small vessel disease: arteriolosclerosis-related cerebral small vessel disease and amyloid-related cerebral small vessel disease. Diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space is an important non-invasive tool for assessing the clearance function of the glymphatic system. However, the effectiveness of its parameters needs to be enhanced. Among various nervous system diseases, including cerebral small vessel disease, glymphatic failure may be a common final pathway toward dementia. Overall, this review summarizes prevention and treatment strategies that target glymphatic drainage and will offer valuable insight for developing novel treatments for cerebral small vessel disease. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012299071

Metabolic small molecule alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG) and D-mannose displayed promising bone homeostasis rebalance and inflammatory suppression properties respectively. However, traditional oral administrated greatly limits their bioavailability. To rescue the bone regeneration suppression from diabetic conditions, a bioactive hydrogel (GelhMSS) was developed with αKG loaded in degradable spiky mesoporous silica nanoparticles and D-mannose conjugated in the hydrogel network. Owning to the special spiky architecture of this nano-vehicle, the high-efficiently internalized and subsequently released αKG metabolically regulated multiple cellular processes and remarkably rescued the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs under diabetic conditions. Simultaneously, the conjugated mannose specifically binds with its receptors on the membrane of macrophages and thereafter induces the polarization of macrophages and reprograms the diabetic immune-microenvironment. Moreover, the resulting GelhMSS hydrogel could also synchronously orchestrate the crosstalk between BMSCs and macrophages, resulting in the upregulation of IGF-1 and FAM20C in macrophages and the reactivation of suppressed TGF-β1-pSmad pathway in BMSCs. The diabetic defect bone repairing regulated by GelhMSS hydrogel was further evaluated in vivo experiment.

However, genetic predisposition or age-related degeneration can lead to retinal damage that severely impairs vision or causes blindness. Treatment options for retinal diseases are limited, and there is an urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Cell and gene therapies are promising because of the efficacy of delivery systems that transport therapeutic genes to targeted retinal cells. Gene delivery systems hold great promise for treating retinal diseases by enabling the targeted delivery of therapeutic genes to affected cells or by converting endogenous cells into functional ones to facilitate nerve regeneration, potentially restoring vision. This review focuses on two principal categories of gene delivery vectors used in the treatment of retinal diseases: viral and non-viral systems. Viral vectors, including lentiviruses and adeno-associated viruses, exploit the innate ability of viruses to infiltrate cells, which is followed by the introduction of therapeutic genetic material into target cells for gene correction. Lentiviruses can accommodate exogenous genes up to 8 kb in length, but their mechanism of integration into the host genome presents insertion mutation risks. Conversely, adeno-associated viruses are safer, as they exist as episomes in the nucleus, yet their limited packaging capacity constrains their application to a narrower spectrum of diseases, which necessitates the exploration of alternative delivery methods. In parallel, progress has also occurred in the development of novel non-viral delivery systems, particularly those based on liposomal technology. Manipulation of the ratios of hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules within liposomes and the development of new lipid formulations have led to the creation of advanced non-viral vectors. These innovative systems include solid lipid nanoparticles, polymer nanoparticles, dendrimers, polymeric micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles. Compared with their viral counterparts, non-viral delivery systems offer markedly enhanced loading capacities that enable the direct delivery of nucleic acids, mRNA, or protein molecules into cells. This bypasses the need for DNA transcription and processing, which significantly enhances therapeutic efficiency. Nevertheless, the immunogenic potential and accumulation toxicity associated with non-viral particulate systems necessitates continued optimization to reduce adverse effects in vivo. This review explores the various delivery systems for retinal therapies and retinal nerve regeneration, and details the characteristics, advantages, limitations, and clinical applications of each vector type. By systematically outlining these factors, our goal is to guide the selection of the optimal delivery tool for a specific retinal disease, which will enhance treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes while paving the way for more effective and targeted therapeutic interventions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012177431

Exosomes are small and can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing them to target deep brain lesions. Recent studies have demonstrated that exosomes derived from different cell types may exert therapeutic effects by regulating the expression of various inflammatory cytokines, mRNAs, and disease-related proteins, thereby halting the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and exhibiting beneficial effects. However, exosomes are composed of lipid bilayer membranes and lack the ability to recognize specific target cells. This limitation can lead to side effects and toxicity when they interact with non-specific cells. Growing evidence suggests that surface-modified exosomes have enhanced targeting capabilities and can be used as targeted drug-delivery vehicles that show promising results in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of existing research aimed at devising approaches to modify exosomes and elucidating their therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings indicate that exosomes can efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier to facilitate drug delivery and can also serve as early diagnostic markers for neurodegenerative diseases. We introduce the strategies being used to enhance exosome targeting, including genetic engineering, chemical modifications (both covalent, such as click chemistry and metabolic engineering, and non-covalent, such as polyvalent electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, ligand-receptor binding, aptamer-based modifications, and the incorporation of CP05-anchored peptides), and nanomaterial modifications. Research into these strategies has confirmed that exosomes have significant therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases. However, several challenges remain in the clinical application of exosomes.

This behavior, seen in complex systems like biological cells, often defies standard diffusion models. Classical models such as fractional Brownian motion (FBM) and scaled Brownian motion (SBM) assume constant exponents, failing to capture dynamics with varying anomalous parameters. To address this limitations, models like FBM with random exponents (FBMRE) and SBM with random exponents (SBMRE) were introduced. This work proposes an universal procedure based on statistical testing framework that distinguishes between anomalous diffusion models with constant and random anomalous exponents using time-averaged statistics and their ratio-based counterparts. A novel procedure for optimizing time lag selection via divergence measure (here the Hellinger distance) is also proposed. The introduced methodology applies broadly to constant vs. random anomalous diffusion scenarios, with effectiveness depending on statistic selection, time lags, and process properties, as shown in simulations (with the two-point distribution of anomalous exponent) and real-world data analysis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007598295

It is utilized in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases associated with atherosclerosis (AS) through mechanisms purported to involve the clearing of heat and detoxification, as well as the promotion of blood circulation and the removal of blood stasis. Despite its widespread application and reported therapeutic benefits, its exact mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. Aim of this study: This study aimed to confirm the anti-AS efficacy of DXRIII and elucidate its underlying mechanism, specifically focusing on the amelioration of endothelial senescence. Methods: The mechanisms underlying the anti-AS effects of DXRIII were elucidated through network pharmacology analysis. In vivo and in vitro models were established using high-fat diet (HFD) induced ApoE−/− mice and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), respectively. The histopathologic changes of aortic tissues, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, mitophagy, senescence, and FOXO3a/PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway were evaluated through histological staining, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescent probe staining, RT-qPCR, and Western blot. The constituents of DXRIII were identified via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the binding affinity and stability of its active compounds with target proteins were investigated using molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assay. Foxo3a was silenced in vitro by lentiviral transfection to determine its involvement in DXRIII-induced mitophagy. Results: DXRIII effectively ameliorated plaque pathology in AS mice and attenuated endothelial cell senescence. Meanwhile, DXRIII suppressed pro-inflammatory factors and adhesion molecules, mitigated oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, while activating PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy and upregulating FOXO3a expression. Notably, both mitophagy inhibition Mdivi-1 and silencing of FOXO3a in vitro blocked DXRIII's anti-senescence effects. Furthermore, the active ingredients of DXRIII, including berberine, kaempferol, quercetin and luteolin, showed strong binding affinity with FOXO3a and enhanced its protein stability. Conclusion: Our findings for the first time demonstrated that DXRIII effectively alleviates endothelial senescence and HFD-induced AS, possibly by activating FOXO3a and subsequently enhancing PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015218226

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is crucial for influenza management. Our previous studies have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of XBCQ on pulmonary and intestinal injuries induced by influenza A virus (IAV)/Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) co-infection, although the underlying gut-lung axis mechanisms remain to be further elucidated. Aim of the study: We hypothesize that XBCQ ameliorates secondary SPN infection by modulating the gut-lung axis through microbiota-metabolite-immune interactions, and we will evaluate its protective effects and mechanistic basis against IAV-induced secondary SPN infection through integrated multi-omics analyses (gut microbiota and metabolomics). Materials and methods: Chemical profiling of XBCQ was performed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS). A sequential infection model was established by intranasal inoculation of IAV followed by SPN to mimic post-influenza secondary bacterial infection. Therapeutic efficacy was validated through quantification of viral/bacterial loads, histopathological analysis, inflammatory cytokines, and intestinal tight junction (TJ) proteins, demonstrating XBCQ's protective effects on both pulmonary and colonic tissues. 16s RNA sequencing and metabonomics were used to evaluate the mechanism of XBCQ intervention in secondary bacterial infection after influenza. Results: UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS analysis identified 60 bioactive components in XBCQ, including sucrose, adenosine, guanosine, and mulberroside A. XBCQ reduced SPN burden by 81.9 %, restored gut microbiota balance, and modulated host metabolic profiles. Correlation analysis revealed that the microbiota altered by XBCQ was significantly associated with pharmacodynamic indicators and metabolites, further confirming the reliability of these findings. Conclusions: XBCQ prevents SPN superinfection following IAV infection by modulating the microbiota-gut-lung axis. These findings provide a potential scientific basis for the clinical application of XBCQ, offering prospective guidance for preventing bacterial pneumonia during influenza seasons. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014812110

Pilose antler peptide (PAP), extracted from this remedy, offers a promising solution for diabetic fracture nonunion, a debilitating condition marked by hyperglycemia-impaired bone healing. Aim of the study: This study investigates PAP's efficacy in accelerating diabetic fracture repair and delineates its molecular mechanisms, merging ethnopharmacological heritage with modern science. Materials and methods: Diabetic fractures were induced in db/db mice, and PAP's effects were evaluated using micro-CT, histology, and osteogenic marker analysis. In vitro, high glucose-treated MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts mimicked diabetic conditions. Molecular mechanisms were probed via co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), fluorescence colocalization, molecular docking, and genetic modulation. Results: PAP markedly improved fracture healing in diabetic mice, enhancing callus integrity, bone microarchitecture, and osteogenic marker levels. In osteoblasts, PAP counteracted high glucose-induced osteogenic suppression, boosting Runx2 expression while inhibiting CREB and Smad3 activation. Co-IP revealed PAP's disruption of the CREB-Smad2/3 complex, with colocalization showing diminished nuclear overlap of CREB and Smad2/3. Molecular docking identified PAP binding to CREB-Arg117 and Smad3-Glu246, supporting its inhibitory role. Genetic studies confirmed PAP's reversal of Smad2/3-mediated Runx2 suppression. Conclusion: PAP alleviates metabolic stress and promotes bone regeneration by targeting the CREB-Smad2/3-Runx2 axis.

Of all bioceramics, the “Whitlockite” is an ideal material with remarkable potential and distinctive properties. Over the past decade, Whitlockite (nWH), a magnesium-containing calcium phosphate, has gained intense attention in biomedical research. The synthesis of nWH was challenging due to its similarities with other Mg-containing Calcium phosphates. The synthesis of nWH requires attention to various parameters such as pH, temperature, precursor, and ageing time. It requires precise control over specific material properties such as size, crystal growth, Temperature, etc. These parameters help in enhancing its biological applications and result in pure nWH synthesis. Recently, various metal and lanthanide elements doped nWH were developed which enhances various additional properties such as antibacterial, hemostasis, anticancer therapy, tissue engineering, etc. nWH also play a vital role in tissue engineering due to its eccentric properties such as good stability, enhanced osteogenesis, neuro-angiogenesis, and many other potential properties making it a versatile bioceramic in this era.

Recently, the advent of additive manufacturing (AM), which allows the generation of complex geometries and customized implants, has introduced a new dimension to the production of these biomedical devices. However, examining the effects of newly developed manufacturing methods on material and sample properties is extremely important to obtain successful products. In this study, additive manufactured and wrought Ti6Al4V samples were implemented for their corrosion resistance and biocompatibility as orthopedic implant material. Three different post processes such as sandblasting, acid etching and bioactive coating (hydroxyapatite-chitosan composite via electrophoretic deposition (EPD)) were applied on the additive manufactured sample surfaces, while only the bioactive coating was applied on the wrought sample surfaces and their effects on the corrosion and biocompatibility were evaluated with the reference of untreated control samples.

While the bivalent RSVpreF vaccine has been shown to protect against RSV-related respiratory tract disease, its impact on severe RSV-related and broader cardiorespiratory hospitalizations remains untested in a fully powered randomized trial. This pragmatic, individually randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial aims to evaluate RSVpreF vaccine effectiveness (VE) in reducing the risk of RSV-related and all-cause cardiorespiratory hospitalizations in adults aged 60 and older. Methods: DAN-RSV is randomizing Danish adults 1:1 to receive either RSVpreF or no RSV vaccine. The trial uses nationwide registries for recruitment, where eligible citizens are identified and invited via the national electronic messaging system and can provide electronic informed consent remotely. Baseline, safety, and outcome data are collected through the national health registries using the civil registration number provided at consent. Up to 130,000 participants will be enrolled during the 2024/2025 winter season. The primary objective is to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) against RSV-related respiratory tract disease hospitalization. Secondary endpoints include RSV-related and all-cause lower respiratory tract disease hospitalizations, RSV-related and all-cause cardiorespiratory hospitalizations, and all-cause death. Conclusion: DAN-RSV is an innovative trial combining the gold standard of individual randomization with pragmatic data collection via centralized health records and national health registries. This design offers a feasible approach to assess the impact of RSVpreF on clinically meaningful cardio-respiratory outcomes in adults ≥60 years in a real-world setting – while minimizing bias through use of randomization. The results will support cost-effectiveness analyses and inform future vaccination policies.

However, as a crucial travel mode, high-deck coaches, have been overlooked, lacking a dedicated evacuation model, let alone exploratory simulation analyses. This work proposes an innovative high-deck coach evacuation model framework, where three intertwined modules are developed to separately delineate the strategic, tactical and operational passenger evacuation behaviours. In the strategic behaviour module, the Cox-Weibull hazard duration model is introduced to capture the pre-evacuation times of passengers so that both the distribution characteristics and the dependence on the proximity to the target exit are encapsulated. In the tactical and operational behaviour modules, elaborate behavioural rules are designed and coupled with Cumulative Prospect Theory to comprehensively incorporate the typical behavioural characteristics and decision-making factors of passengers. The framework is validated with empirical data from various scenarios and proven to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art passenger evacuation model. It is found that the CWM substantially improves the prediction accuracy of the framework compared with the Weibull probabilistic distribution. Overtaking behaviour significantly affects passenger evacuations, but does not induce any benefit for the overall system.

However, this approach has not been tested in mares despite the common use of transvaginal oocyte aspiration for oocyte collection to produce equine embryos in vitro. Our study aimed to investigate the feasibility of isolating MSCs from equine ovarian follicular aspirates obtained by ovum pick-up (OPU). Follicular aspirates from six mares were processed to establish adherent cell cultures. Our results showed that these cells exhibited the spindle-like morphology associated with MSCs. Isolated cells were positive for CD29 and CD90 (characteristic MSCs surface markers), and negative for CD45 and CD19 (hematopoietic markers), as well as major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) as asessed by flow cytometry. Gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR revealed significant upregulation of the MSC-related genes THY1 and FGF2 in cultured cells compared to the native follicular aspirates, indicating the enrichment of a MSCs population during in vitro expansion. Trilineage differentiation into adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages was successfully demonstrated by morphological differentiation and specific staining. These findings demonstrate that equine ovarian follicular aspirates contain a viable population of MSCs that can be efficiently isolated, expanded, and differentiated in vitro. This work offers a novel and practical alternative for obtaining equine MSCs, with potential applications in the development of cell-based therapies within the reproductive and regenerative contexts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014249697

This study integrates advanced transcriptomic (RNA sequencing) and biomechanical modeling approaches to uncover the key molecular pathways and mechanical properties that drive bone repair. Using a rat femoral delayed fracture model, researchers analyzed gene expression changes, immune cell dynamics, and tissue mechanics at different healing stages. The findings reveal critical shifts in inflammation, cartilage formation, and bone remodeling, highlighting the role of signaling pathways such as Wnt and TGF-β in regulating these transitions. Additionally, the study introduces a genomechanical (GM) model that incorporates gene expression data into predictive biomechanical simulations. This approach allows for a more accurate prediction of tissue differentiation and mechanical strength changes over time. The study demonstrates how genetic and mechanical factors work together to optimize healing and identifies potential therapeutic targets to improve fracture recovery, especially in conditions such as diabetes, aging, and obesity, where healing is impaired. Importantly, this work introduces an integrative modeling framework that incorporates dynamic upstream regulator activity into a mechanoregulatory framework, enabling time-resolved simulation of gene-driven tissue transitions. The GM model provides a biologically informed platform for predicting healing trajectories and identifying optimal therapeutic windows, setting the stage for future applications in personalized and condition-specific treatment planning. By bridging molecular biology with mechanical modeling, this research provides new insights into the biological mechanisms of bone repair, paving the way for personalized treatment strategies. The GM model offers a powerful tool for predicting healing outcomes and designing targeted interventions, ultimately improving patient care in orthopaedic medicine.

Comprehensive characterization of the biomass samples, including elemental, proximate, structural, and calorific analyses, was performed to evaluate their suitability for HTL. The process was conducted in subcritical water conditions at 260°C and 7–10 MPa, with a residence time of 40 min. Results were compared with advanced catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL-ACT) using tandem Ni-Pt/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> and Pd-C/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> conformed catalysts, with glycerol as an in situ hydrogen donor. Lipid and protein-rich biomasses, such as microalgae and energy crop seeds, achieved higher biocrude yields (∼50 %) with elevated Higher Heating Values (HHVs) ranging from 21–32 MJ·kg−1 under HTL-D. Conversely, lignocellulosic biomass, such as sugarcane bagasse, yielded significantly to lower biocrude fraction (9–10 %) due to its high cellulose and lignin content. The introduction of tandem catalysts and glycerol in HTL-ACT slightly enhanced biocrude yields, up to 65 %, increased the H/C ratio, reduced the O/C ratio, and improved deoxygenation and calorific value compared to HTL-D, obtaining a biocrude with 40 and 42 MJ·kg−1 for the Scenedesmus tubularis microalgae and Yellow Horn defatted seed, respectively.

Despite extensive research, effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies remain limited. This review explores the emerging roles of exosomal non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) as biomarkers and therapeutic agents in TBI. Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles secreted by various cell types, facilitate intercellular communication and carry diverse ncRNAs that modulate gene expression and cellular functions. The pathogenesis of TBI involves complex inflammatory cascades, in which exosomal ncRNAs play pivotal roles in neuroinflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and secondary injury mechanisms. Key ncRNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), have been identified as potential biomarkers for diagnosing TBI and predicting outcomes. Additionally, exosomal ncRNAs derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) show promise in promoting neuroprotection and enhancing recovery through various mechanisms. The review highlights the potential of exosomal ncRNAs in addressing critical unmet needs in TBI management, emphasizing their stability, accessibility, and relevance to disease pathophysiology. However, challenges in standardization, validation, and regulatory pathways must be addressed to facilitate their clinical application.

Cerebellar microglia exhibit specialized and highly immunogenic phenotypes under both physiological and pathological conditions. These immune cells communicate with intrinsic and systemic factors and contribute to the structural and functional compartmentalization of the cerebellum. In this review, we discuss the roles of microglia in the cerebellar microenvironment, neuroinflammation, cerebellar adaptation, and neuronal activity, the associated molecular and cellular mechanisms, and potential therapeutic strategies targeting cerebellar microglia in the context of neuroinflammation. Future directions and unresolved questions in this field are further highlighted, particularly regarding therapeutic interventions targeting cerebellar microglia, functional mechanisms and activities of microglia in the cerebellar circuitry, neuronal connectivity, and neurofunctional outcomes of their activity. Cerebellar morphology and neuronal performance are influenced by both intrinsic and systemic factors that are actively monitored by microglia in both healthy and diseased states. Under pathological conditions, local subsets of microglia exhibit diverse responses to the altered microenvironment that contribute to the structural and functional compartmentalization of the cerebellum. Microglia in the cerebellum undergo early maturation during the embryonic stage and display specialized, highly immunogenic phenotypes.

Although various intrinsic reparative processes are initiated within the ischemic brain, these mechanisms are often insufficient to restore neuronal functionality. This has led to intensive investigation into the use of exogenous stem cells as a potential therapeutic option. This comprehensive review outlines the ontogeny and mechanisms of activation of endogenous neural stem cells within the adult brain following ischemic events, with focus on the impact of stem cell-based therapies on neural stem cells. Exogenous stem cells have been shown to enhance the proliferation of endogenous neural stem cells via direct cell-to-cell contact and through the secretion of growth factors and exosomes. Additionally, implanted stem cells may recruit host stem cells from their niches to the infarct area by establishing so-called 'biobridges.' Furthermore, xenogeneic and allogeneic stem cells can modify the microenvironment of the infarcted brain tissue through immunomodulatory and angiogenic effects, thereby supporting endogenous neuroregeneration. Given the convergence of regulatory pathways between exogenous and endogenous stem cells and the necessity for a supportive microenvironment, we discuss three strategies to simultaneously enhance the therapeutic efficacy of both cell types. These approaches include: (1) co-administration of various growth factors and pharmacological agents alongside stem cell transplantation to reduce stem cell apoptosis; (2) synergistic administration of stem cells and their exosomes to amplify paracrine effects; and (3) integration of stem cells within hydrogels, which provide a protective scaffold for the implanted cells while facilitating the regeneration of neural tissue and the reconstitution of neural circuits.

Adiponectin, a cell-secreted protein hormone, has recently been found to regulate synaptic plasticity and mediate the antidepressant effects of physical exercise. Studies on the neuroprotective effects of adiponectin have revealed potential innovative treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Here, we reviewed the functions of adiponectin and its receptor in the brains of human and animal models of cognitive impairment. We summarized the role of adiponectin in Alzheimer's disease, focusing on its impact on energy metabolism, insulin resistance, and inflammation.

However, the precise mechanism remains poorly understood. In this study, we administered chitosan intragastrically to an MPTP-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease and found that it effectively reduced dopamine neuron injury, neurotransmitter dopamine release, and motor symptoms. These neuroprotective effects of chitosan were related to bacterial metabolites, specifically short-chain fatty acids, and chitosan administration altered intestinal microbial diversity and decreased short-chain fatty acid production in the gut. Furthermore, chitosan effectively reduced damage to the intestinal barrier and the blood-brain barrier. Finally, we demonstrated that chitosan improved intestinal barrier function and alleviated inflammation in both the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system by reducing acetate levels. Based on these findings, we suggest a molecular mechanism by which chitosan decreases inflammation through reducing acetate levels and repairing the intestinal and blood-brain barriers, thereby alleviating symptoms of Parkinson's disease. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012452864

The glymphatic system, a recently identified perivascular fluid transport network, is crucial for clearing neurotoxic proteins. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the role of the glymphatic system in α-synuclein clearance and its implications for the pathology of Parkinson's disease while emphasizing potential therapeutic strategies and areas for future research. The review begins with an overview of the glymphatic system and details its anatomical structure and physiological functions that facilitate cerebrospinal fluid circulation and waste clearance. It summarizes emerging evidence from neuroimaging and experimental studies that highlight the close correlation between the glymphatic system and clinical symptom severity in patients with Parkinson's disease, as well as the effect of glymphatic dysfunction on α-synuclein accumulation in Parkinson's disease models. Subsequently, the review summarizes the mechanisms of glymphatic system impairment in Parkinson's disease, including sleep disturbances, aquaporin-4 impairment, and mitochondrial dysfunction, all of which diminish glymphatic system efficiency. This creates a vicious cycle that exacerbates α-synuclein accumulation and worsens Parkinson's disease. The therapeutic perspectives section outlines strategies for enhancing glymphatic activity, such as improving sleep quality and pharmacologically targeting aquaporin-4 or its subcellular localization. Promising interventions include deep brain stimulation, melatonin supplementation, γ-aminobutyric acid modulation, and non-invasive methods (such as exercise and bright-light therapy), multisensory γ stimulation, and ultrasound therapy. Moreover, identifying neuroimaging biomarkers to assess glymphatic flow as an indicator of α-synuclein burden could refine Parkinson's disease diagnosis and track disease progression. In conclusion, the review highlights the critical role of the glymphatic system in α-synuclein clearance and its potential as a therapeutic target in Parkinson's disease. It advocates for further research to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which the glymphatic system clears misfolded α-synuclein and the development of imaging biomarkers to monitor glymphatic activity in patients with Parkinson's disease. Findings from this review suggest that enhancing glymphatic clearance is a promising strategy for reducing α-synuclein deposits and mitigating the progression of Parkinson's disease. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012449097

In recent decades, studies have revealed that gut microbiota can communicate bidirectionally with the brain through the gut microbiota–brain axis. This axis indicates that gut microbiota is closely related to the development and prognosis of intracerebral hemorrhage and its associated secondary white matter injury. The NACHT, LRR, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a crucial role in this context. This review summarizes the dysbiosis of gut microbiota following intracerebral hemorrhage and explores the mechanisms by which this imbalance may promote the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. These mechanisms include metabolic pathways (involving short-chain fatty acids, lipopolysaccharides, lactic acid, bile acids, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and tryptophan), neural pathways (such as the vagus nerve and sympathetic nerve), and immune pathways (involving microglia and T cells). We then discuss the relationship between the activated NLRP3 inflammasome and secondary white matter injury after intracerebral hemorrhage. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can exacerbate secondary white matter injury by disrupting the blood–brain barrier, inducing neuroinflammation, and interfering with nerve regeneration. Finally, we outline potential treatment strategies for intracerebral hemorrhage and its secondary white matter injury. Our review highlights the critical role of the gut microbiota–brain axis and the NLRP3 inflammasome in white matter injury following intracerebral hemorrhage, paving the way for exploring potential therapeutic approaches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012362370

In advanced stages, surgical intervention through total knee replacement is frequently performed; however, only about two-thirds of individuals report that their knee feels “normal” after the procedure. Postoperative complications can also lead to additional corrective surgery. Although early stage management through physical activity and weight reduction can slow disease progression, surgical replacement remains the standard treatment for severe cases. Accurate assessment of muscle volume plays an essential role not only in the management of osteoarthritis but also in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions such as muscular dystrophy, peripheral arterial disease, neurological disorders, sports-related injuries, and age-associated muscle degeneration. Despite this, clinical practice lacks standardized and repeatable methods for muscle volume quantification, which poses a challenge for accurate diagnosis and effective intervention. This work introduces a comprehensive model that employs wavelet transform-based noise reduction for preprocessing, a dual attention-based segmentation network for enhanced muscle region identification, and an optimization method inspired by the hunting behavior of the Aquila birds for effective feature selection. Muscle classification was performed using a convolutional neural network designed to capture multiscale features with dilated filters, and hyperparameter optimization was performed using a biologically inspired strategy modeled after the flight patterns of the black-winged kite. The framework was evaluated using imaging data from the Osteoarthritis initiative dataset. The results showed strong performance, with 99.5 percent accuracy, 99.1 percent precision, 99.4 percent recall, 99.3 percent F1 score, 98.9 percent specificity, and 98.5 percent Dice similarity score. Validation using five-fold cross-validation confirmed the robustness of the system. In addition, the ablation work highlighted the contribution of each model component to overall performance, while the proposed system offers practical benefits such as supporting the clinical diagnosis of musculoskeletal conditions, enhancing pre- and post-surgical assessments, and enabling more efficient monitoring of muscle health in both rehabilitation and aging-related studies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012302886

However, despite the availability of more than 20 antiseizure medications, more than one-third of patients continue to experience seizures. Given the urgent need to explore new treatment strategies for epilepsy, recent research has highlighted the potential of targeting gliosis, metabolic disturbances, and neural circuit abnormalities as therapeutic strategies. Astrocytes, the largest group of nonneuronal cells in the central nervous system, play several crucial roles in maintaining ionic and energy metabolic homeostasis in neurons, regulating neurotransmitter levels, and modulating synaptic plasticity. This article briefly reviews the critical role of astrocytes in maintaining balance within the central nervous system. Building on previous research, we discuss how astrocyte dysfunction contributes to the onset and progression of epilepsy through four key aspects: the imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling, dysregulation of metabolic homeostasis in the neuronal microenvironment, neuroinflammation, and the formation of abnormal neural circuits. We summarize relevant basic research conducted over the past 5 years that has focused on modulating astrocytes as a therapeutic approach for epilepsy. We categorize the therapeutic targets proposed by these studies into four areas: restoration of the excitation-inhibition balance, reestablishment of metabolic homeostasis, modulation of immune and inflammatory responses, and reconstruction of abnormal neural circuits. These targets correspond to the pathophysiological mechanisms by which astrocytes contribute to epilepsy. Additionally, we need to consider the potential challenges and limitations of translating these identified therapeutic targets into clinical treatments. These limitations arise from interspecies differences between humans and animal models, as well as the complex comorbidities associated with epilepsy in humans. We also highlight valuable future research directions worth exploring in the treatment of epilepsy and the regulation of astrocytes, such as gene therapy and imaging strategies. The findings presented in this review may help open new therapeutic avenues for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and for those suffering from other central nervous system disorders associated with astrocytic dysfunction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012197187

Regarding preclinical research, exosomes, as bioactive substances with diverse sources, currently favor stem cells as their origin. Due to their high plasticity, exosomes can be effectively modified through various physical, chemical, and genetic engineering methods to enhance their efficacy. In animal models of stroke, exosome therapy can reduce neuroinflammatory responses, alleviate oxidative stress damage, and inhibit programmed cell death. Additionally, exosomes can promote angiogenesis, repair and regenerate damaged white matter fiber bundles, and facilitate the migration and differentiation of neural stem cells, aiding the repair process.

LTBI is a critical link in TB prevention and control but is also a major obstacle to achieving TB eradication. Current diagnostic methods, such as the tuberculin skin test and interferon-γ release assays, have limitations.

This condition significantly increases the risk of cardiometabolic complications such as atherosclerosis, thromboembolic events, and worsened cardiovascular outcomes. In recent years, metabolomics—particularly lipidomics—has emerged as a powerful approach for elucidating the metabolic dysregulation associated with psoriasis. Lipidomic techniques, including Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS), and UPLC-Quadrupole Time-of-Flight MS (UPLC-QTOF-MS), have enabled the detection and quantification of disease-relevant lipid species. Despite advancements, the inherent structural complexity and diversity of lipid molecules present substantial analytical challenges, particularly in method standardization and cross-study comparison. Nonetheless, specific lipid classes play a central role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Additionally, fatty acids and their bioactive metabolites modulate cutaneous inflammation and skin barrier function.

Microglia play an important role in secondary injury and can be activated in response to traumatic brain injury. In this article, we review the origin and classification of microglia as well as the dynamic changes of microglia in traumatic brain injury. We also clarify the microglial polarization pathways and the therapeutic drugs targeting activated microglia. We found that regulating the signaling pathways involved in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory microglia, such as the Toll-like receptor 4 /nuclear factor-kappa B, mitogen-activated protein kinase, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B, Notch, and high mobility group box 1 pathways, can alleviate the inflammatory response triggered by microglia in traumatic brain injury, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects.

This abstract explores the emerging significance of miR-155, both as an intracellular regulator and encapsulated within exosomes, as a biomarker and therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disorders. Dysregulation of miR-155 is implicated in various conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, where it modulates key pathways involved in neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and immune cell activation. Specifically, miR-155 has been shown to influence microglial activation, cytokine production, and the clearance of protein aggregates, all critical processes in neurodegenerative pathogenesis. Exosomal miR-155, released by various cell types including immune cells and neurons, offers a particularly exciting avenue. These nanovesicles facilitate intercellular communication, delivering their cargo, including miR-155, to recipient cells and influencing their function. As such, exosomal miR-155 levels in biofluids like cerebrospinal fluid and blood are being investigated as potential non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the ability of exosomes to cross the blood–brain barrier makes them attractive vehicles for targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. This review highlights the dual promise of miR-155 and exosomal miR-155: first, as readily measurable indicators of disease progression and response to treatment, and second, as actionable targets for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating neuroinflammation and protecting neuronal integrity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011516031

However, the early and accurate detection of biomarkers, which is essential for guiding risk stratification and therapeutic decision-making, is constrained by the sensitivity and throughput limitations of conventional assays. This review critically examines advances in immunoassay technologies, including high-sensitivity lipase and amylase ELISAs, chemiluminescence and time-resolved fluorescence formats, label-free plasmonic sensors, digital single-molecule platforms, and multiplex bead-based and microarray systems, as applied to pancreatitis biomarker quantitation. This study synthesizes data on classical enzymatic markers, such as lipase and amylase, established proteins, including C-reactive protein and trypsinogen activation peptide, and emerging molecular targets, such as cytokines, DAMPs, and microRNAs. The focus is on evaluating analytical performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, dynamic range, precision, and robustness, along with preanalytical factors and clinical applications. These components are analyzed in relation to early diagnosis, assessment of severity, and evaluation of therapeutic response. Current challenges in assay standardization, head-to-head validation, and preanalytical variability are highlighted, and the potential of microfluidic “lab-on-a-chip” and point-of-care platforms is explored. This review effectively integrates advanced immunoassay modalities with the performance of pancreatitis-specific biomarkers, thereby uniquely linking technological innovation to clinical applicability.

However, the intricate anatomical structure and the blood–brain barrier (BBB) of the brain present challenges for intracerebral drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy. Although systemic administration and surgical interventions can alleviate symptoms, they are limited by low therapeutic effects and potential adverse side effects. Moreover, due to their complex pathogenesis, insidious development, and deep-seated lesions, brain diseases are difficult to diagnose accurately. To address these challenges, there is an urgent need to develop intelligent nanocarriers that can efficiently load drugs and penetrate the BBB for precise therapy of brain diseases. In this connection, micro/nanorobots (MNRs) are multifunctional drug carriers at the micro-nano scale, which possess exceptional penetration and targeting capabilities. Employing externally powered propulsion or chemical self-propulsion, MNRs can navigate in the brain and cross the BBB. This review comprehensively summarizes the recent advances and future outlook of smart MNR drug delivery systems for brain disease treatment. It covers broad topics from nanocarriers to active smart MNRs. Furthermore, it elucidates the therapeutic mechanisms of these smart MNR drug delivery systems in brain diseases based on pathogenesis and pathology. Our aim is to provide a reference for designing and developing novel smart MNRs for drug delivery in the brain, paving the way for their clinical applications in treating brain diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010303279

Ferroptosis arising from iron overload represents a crucial pathological characteristic of osteoporosis, depleting osteoblasts and disturbing bone metabolism. Inspired by natural tremella polysaccharide (TP), we developed an injectable composite hydrogel (OGP@DTrep) capable of inhibiting cell ferroptosis via dual mechanisms. Following the incorporation of methacrylated TP, oxidized TP, thioketal (TK), and osteogenic growth peptide (OGP), OGP@DTrep exhibits a range of biological activities including intelligent reactive oxygen species (ROS) response and drug release, immunomodulation, promotion of angiogenesis, and inhibition of osteoclast activity. More importantly, since the carboxyl group in TP and the hydroxyl group of the sugar unit can form salt bridge interactions and hydrogen bond linkages with free iron ions, respectively, OGP@DTrep can efficiently chelate excessive iron ions in the microenvironment. Moreover, OGP@DTrep increases the intracellular antioxidant capacity, inhibits osteoblast ferroptosis, and enhances bone matrix secretion. In a rat model of osteoporotic bone defects, it reversed iron metabolism imbalance, restoring bone mass and microstructure. This study presents a naturally derived biomaterial with multiple activities, such as a ROS response and iron metabolism regulation, offering a new perspective for treating osteoporotic bone defects and other bone diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010187122

The mPDA structure significantly enhanced ROS-scavenging and anti-inflammatory activities, while the surface-encapsulated MSCm enabled effective blood-brain barrier traversal and targeted the lesion site in the PD brain. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that mPDA@MSC exerted anti-Parkinsonian effects through multiple mechanisms, including ROS scavenging, modulation of mitochondrial dysfunction, and promotion of the transition from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory microglial phenotypes. This resulted in the reversal of dopaminergic neuron damage, inhibition of α-synuclein (α-syn) production, and improvement in behavioral deficits and other phenotypes.

OBJECTIVE: To review the mechanism and clinical application of probiotics in the treatment of peri-implantitis. METHODS: Relevant literature was searched on PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, and WanFang Data, using the search terms of “probiotics, peri-implantitis, flora imbalance, immunoregulation, inflammatory reaction, mechanism of action” in Chinese and English. A total of 90 articles were finally included. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Probiotics have the following mechanisms. They can activate the anti-inflammatory mechanism by inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory factors and promoting the production of anti-inflammatory factors. They can destroy the cell wall of pathogenic bacteria by secreting microbial complexes and bacteriocins, reduce the pH value of biofilms, improve the composition of microorganisms in microecology, induce the change of bacterial community structure, and restore the balance of microbial population around implants. They have immunomodulatory effects and can enhance the resistance of the host oral mucosa to pathogenic bacteria in the surrounding area of the implant. In addition, probiotics can produce antibacterial compounds, offset the adhesion of pathogenic microorganisms, and regulate immune function. Through the above mechanisms, probiotics have certain potential in the adjuvant treatment of peri-implantitis, which can improve the clinical parameters of peri-implantitis and affect the microbiota. Probiotic therapy provides a new treatment option, but more long-term prospective studies are needed to further verify its effect. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008997379

However, this treatment method suffers from poor contact, drug wastage and limited delivery depth compromising therapeutic efficacy. Local injections address some of these challenges but are invasive and cause significant pain. In response, we develop a transdermal delivery system utilizing type 1 recombinant human collagen (1-RHC) to integrate PRP within a hydrogel microneedle patch (MNP). The reaction of methacrylic anhydride with 1-RHC yields methacrylate RHC (1-RHCMA), which when combined with PRP, self-assembles into an arrow-shaped MNP, 1-RHCMA-PRP Arrow-MNP (RPAM) via a triple-molding process. The 1-RHCMA-PRP hydrogel demonstrates pro-epithelial, pro-angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties in vitro. When applied to rat diabetic wound models, RPAM also regulates collagen alignment and demonstrates robust mechanical properties which can prevent pathological scar formation by stabilizing the wound bed. Transcriptome sequencing further confirms that RPAM promotes excellent healing via pro-keratinization and modulation of immune response. Additionally, RPAM exhibits no toxicity to any organs within the organism, mitigating any immunogenic concerns.

Current treatment options are limited and often yield unfavorable outcomes. Given that tendons are highly mechanosensitive tissues, recent studies highlight the crucial role of mechanotransduction in tissue repair. Piezo1, a mechanosensitive ion channel, has been recognized as a crucial factor attributing to many pathological processes in various tissues, but its specific role in tendon healing has not been previously explored. This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic benefits of GsMTx4-loaded GelMA on tendon regeneration and the prevention of heterotopic ossification following injury. Our findings indicate that following tendon injuries, Piezo1 expression was elevated. Activation of Piezo1 with Yoda1 suppressed osteogenic differentiation while promoting chondrogenic differentiation of tendon-derived stem cells. Treatment with GsMTx4 enhanced tendon healing and mitigated the formation of heterotopic ossification. RNA sequencing further implicated the Apelin signaling pathway in these processes, and inhibition of this pathway using ML221 significantly suppressed HO formation, suggesting a pivotal role for Apelin in tendon healing and ossification. Additionally, short-term immobilization was found to attenuate heterotopic ossification by modulating Piezo1 activity. Thus, inhibition of Piezo1 enhances tendon healing and reduces heterotopic ossification, potentially through the Apelin signaling pathway. These results underscore the critical role of Piezo1 in tendon biology and highlight the potential of targeting mechanosensitive ion channels, especially Piezo1, as a novel therapeutic approach for promoting tendon regeneration and preventing heterotopic ossification. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008433390

Carbon nanomaterials are well known to act as drug delivery systems for therapeutics. Nonetheless, their inherent capabilities in combating tumor cells remain underexplored. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of novel boronate-incorporated alginate carbon nanogels (Bor/Alg-CNGs) as promising anti-metastatic agents for effectively suppressing migration and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, while triggering cell-cycle arrest. Notably, Bor/Alg-CNGs decreased cell viability of TNBC cells through disorganization of F-actin, a critical factor mediating cellular migration. In an in vivo study, Bor/Alg-CNGs reduced metastatic lung nodules in a tumor-induced mouse model by >85 %, compared to the untreated controls. Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses further validated the in vivo results with an in-depth understanding of the role of Bor/Alg-CNGs in the stress response of reactive oxygen species-induced cells and downregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway, leading to metabolic breakdown, cell growth arrest, and apoptosis. These findings underscore the potent anti-metastatic properties of Bor/Alg-CNGs based on their multifunctional role in inhibiting cellular mechanisms essential for metastasis. Compared to many existing carbon nanomaterials, Bor/Alg-CNGs offer enhanced specificity and efficiency in targeting metastatic pathways. Their ability to target and disrupt metastatic processes while minimizing side effects holds the potential for development as a new class of anti-metastatic agents in cancer therapy, warranting further mechanistic and clinical investigations to realize their full therapeutic potential. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007979762

Therefore, development of novel therapeutic strategies is urgently required. Since macrophage recruitment increases during liver fibrosis progression, macrophage membrane-coated biomimetic complexes can be designed for targeted anti-liver fibrosis therapy. In this study, a biomimetic “gas-gene” strategy was proposed to enhance anti-liver fibrosis efficacy. A macrophage membrane-coated carbon nitride-based biomimetic delivery platform loaded with DNA nanoparticles (M-PEISeCCNs@DNA) was developed. The macrophage membrane coating facilitated the delivery of M-PEISeCCNs@SBP1 to the liver fibrosis site and reversed the positive charge of the carriers to avoid cation-induced cytotoxicity. Under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, M-PEISeCCNs@SBP1 could trigger water splitting to produce O<inf>2</inf>, thereby mitigating hypoxia and alleviating liver fibrosis. The light-responsive release of the SBP1-DNA plasmid was also achieved through carrier photolysis. The delivered SBP1-DNA and the Se element within the vectors synergistically upregulated the expression of selenium-binding protein-1 (SBP1). Additionally, we demonstrated for the first time that SBP1 is an effective therapeutic target for liver fibrosis, and its overexpression inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and attenuates CCl<inf>4</inf>-induced liver fibrosis in mice. In this experiment, M-PEISeCCNs@SBP1 effectively treated liver fibrosis in mice through the SBP1-mediated NOTCH2/Wnt pathway. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007736801

Traditional therapeutic approaches are often associated with complications such as donor site morbidity and immune rejection, underscoring the necessity for the development of advanced strategies. This review examines H-type blood vessels, a recently identified subtype that plays a pivotal role in linking osteogenesis and angiogenesis. These vessels are distinguished by specific functional phenotypes and are characterized by high co-expression of CD31 and endomucin (Emcn). While various strategies have been explored to enhance osteogenesis, inadequate vascularization remains a major obstacle in effective bone defect repair. Here, we categorize and critically evaluate biomaterials based on their compositions, which facilitate the formation of H-type vessels in the bone microenvironment by modulating key signaling pathways that promote osteogenic-angiogenic coupling. The integration of findings from diverse animal models provides valuable insights into the design principles of materials that optimize the formation of vascular networks alongside bone regeneration. This review also discusses the persisting challenges and potential future directions for the development of clinically translatable biomaterial therapies aimed at achieving functional restoration of vascularized bone tissue. These advancements not only enhance our understanding of H-type vessels biology but also provide a strategic framework for addressing the critical limitation of vascular insufficiency in bone repair. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007669518

Accumulation of brown fat enhances energy expenditure and could be a strategy to fight obesity. While approaches to induce browning in animals for therapeutic purposes have been tested, clinically applicable options are limited. Here, we propose chemically induced in vivo brown adipogenic reprogramming for the therapeutic application of brown adipocytes. By phenotypic screening, we identified a novel combination of two small molecules, SB431542 (SB) and NKH477 (NK), a TGFβ inhibitor and a cAMP activator, respectively, that could reprogram mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to adipocyte-like cells with brown/beige adipocyte properties. We demonstrated that the expression of both Pparγ and Cebpβ via TGFβ inhibition and cAMP activation is essential for the increased activation of UCP1 due to the synergistic effects of SB and NK combination (SBNK) on adipogenesis. We further demonstrated the potential clinical application of this in vivo brown adipogenic reprogramming by showing that high-fat diet (HFD)–fed mice treated intraperitoneally with the SBNK exhibited enhanced browning capacity and were protected from HFD-induced impairment of glucose metabolism. Finally, microneedle patches embedded with SBNK-loaded nanoparticles were applied to the mice's skin around subcutaneous white adipose tissue to test the efficacy of local delivery, which also showed a browning effect. Taken together, a novel combination of small molecules that synergistically induced browning with far-reaching translatable therapeutic potentials was developed in this study. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007662466

Unfortunately, MEAs tend to fail over chronic time points, limiting their clinical utility. Chronic failure has largely been attributed to the brain's neuroinflammatory response. Until recently, most of what was understood about the neuroinflammatory response to MEAs was learned through immunohistochemical analysis of small numbers of proteins. More recently, gene expression studies have sequenced thousands of mRNA molecules that contribute to neuroinflammation, but few studies have performed large-scale proteomic analyses. To expand the knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved, we have previously investigated the activity of 62 proteins within 180 μm of the MEA implant site using a spatial proteomic platform. In the present study, we are the first to apply large-scale genomics and proteomics to MEAs, as we evaluate changes in both the whole protein-encoding mouse transcriptome and our 62-protein proteomic panel. We further examine the spatial distribution of the neuroinflammatory response within three distinct domains adjacent to the MEA: 0–90 μm, 90–180 μm, and 180–270 μm from the implant site. Our analysis directly compares the gene and protein expression and highlights the need for segmentation based on proximal distance from the implant site. We also identify key pathways associated with immune cell activation, neurodegeneration, and metabolism that likely contribute to MEA failure and could be targeted to improve MEA performance in future studies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007597959

Sericin, a silk-derived biopolymer, has gained attention as a promising cryoprotectant due to its potent antioxidant, radical-scavenging, and antibacterial properties. This review explores sericin’s potential to improve sperm motility, viability, acrosome integrity, and DNA integrity across 12 species, including goats, bulls, buffalo, poultry, rabbits, boars, dogs, mice, horse, sheep, elephant, and humans by synthesizing findings from over 60 studies that utilized six different cryopreservation methodologies. Sericin has been shown to protect sperm during cryopreservation by reducing oxidative stress, preserving membrane integrity, and enhancing fertilizing capacity. Studies suggest that sericin supplementation may provide comparable or even superior protection compared to traditional cryoprotectants. Additionally, sericin can work synergistically with other additives, such as trehalose and glutathione, to further improve sperm motility and overall post-thaw quality. Despite these promising findings, several challenges hinder the widespread commercial application of sericin such as variability in composition, and scalability remain key limitations. Moreover, excessive sericin concentrations can lead to cytotoxicity, protein aggregation, osmotic imbalance, and increased viscosity, all of which may induce oxidative stress and ultimately impair sperm quality. Therefore, optimizing sericin concentrations is essential to maximize its cryoprotective benefits while minimizing potential adverse effects. Future research should focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying sericin’s protective effects and conducting field trials to validate its efficacy in diverse reproductive contexts. With further development, sericin holds great potential for advancing semen preservation and enhancing reproductive technologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007463367

In this study, the induction of senescence in human melanoma cells by palbociclib is found to lead to a senescent phenotype characterized by overexpression of the membrane protein dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), previously identified only in ageing contexts. Based on this discovery, a nanoparticle targeting DPP4 overexpression in the senescent surfaceome is designed, synthesized, and characterized to target senescent cancer cells. The nanoparticle based on mesoporous silica is loaded with the senolytic navitoclax, coated with disulfide-containing poly(ethylene glycol) to generate a redox-sensitive gatekeeper (S–S-PEG), and functionalized with an antibody against the DPP4 protein. The ability of the nanoparticles to effectively detect and eliminate senescent cells was confirmed in vitro and in vivo using a mouse model of palbociclib-induced senescent in melanoma. The DPP4-targeted nanoparticle effectively reduces tumor growth and selectively removes senescent cells. Taken together, this study highlights the potential of surfaceome-targeted nanoparticles, as a clinically relevant strategy for improving senolytic therapies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007462501

Our previous work measured glial cell responses to stimulation paradigms and highlighted the importance of electrical stimulation considerations when designing a biocompatible neural interfacing device. The formation of voids around stimulating platinum-iridium electrodes also prompted an investigation into the fate of cells that would have once populated that area. Live-imaging experiments involving EGFP-positive microglia from heterozygous CX3CR-1+/EGFP mice were designed. Live-imaging animations over 4 h showed necrotic microglial cell death around stimulating electrodes. The degree to which this was occurring was further analyzed by electrically stimulating mixed glia and modifying parameters such as stimulation amplitude (0.1–0.4 mA), waveform shape (rectangular/sinusoidal/ramped), and frequency (25–55 Hz). The different stimulation parameters had differential effects on glial cell biomarker signal outputs (cell density, fluorescence intensity, area coverage). Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy of the electrode surfaces post-stimulation did not reveal any significant damage or changes to surface elemental composition. Finally, electrochemical testing of the proposed in vitro setup revealed influences of different components of the mixed glial cell cultures towards the electrochemical performance of the electrodes in terms of cathodic charge storage capacity, impedance, phase angle, and voltage transient excursions. The results highlight the impact that electrical stimulation parameters have on glial cell fate at the electrode-cell culture interface, and provide data towards refinement of stimulation paradigms used in electrical neuromodulation applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007419669

Chronic and long-term inflammation drives cancer development, while acute inflammatory reactions often lead to anti-cancer immune responses by stimulating the body's adaptive immunity. However, the over-inflammation post-treatment was usually neglected, which not only impedes therapeutic outcomes but also exacerbates tumor aggressiveness and metastatic spread. Mitigating therapy-induced inflammation has emerged as a critical research frontier to augment therapeutic efficacy and bolster patients' life quality. Herein, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of inflammation induced by cancer therapy as well as the inflammatory side effects were summarized. A range of anti-inflammatory drugs/agents based on emerging biomaterials and novel delivery modalities are compared in light of current clinical advances and experimental results. More importantly, various inflammation-modulating strategies involved in traditional cancer therapies (encompassing surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) and modern novel treatment strategies such as immunotherapy, photothermal therapy, and combination therapies were discussed in detail. Finally, the potential opportunities and challenges existing in inflammation modulation when combined with multiple therapeutic techniques were analyzed with the aim of providing deep and cutting-edge insights for the development of novel inflammation-modulated therapeutics in oncology and therapy-induced inflammatory diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007289399

Developing an efficient therapeutic approach with dual-pronged functionality for the treatment of osteoporosis represents a noteworthy challenge. Herein, samples from humans and rats with osteoporosis presented in this study underscore the correlation between mitochondrial metabolism, epigenetic modifications, and osteoporotic bone loss. Inspired by this, we focus on designing a nano-therapy that serves as a strategy, targeting both the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis and the modulation of epigenetic modifications, thereby achieving a dual-functional effect in the treatment of osteoporosis. Accordingly, 4-octyl itaconate (OI), which exhibits immunometabolic activity and regulates epigenetic modifications, was encapsulated within mesoporous silica (MSN) and further modified with a cerium ion-coordinated tannic acid (Ce-TA) supramolecular network on its surface for boosting antioxidant properties. In brief, MSN-OI@Ce-TA (MOCT NPs) exhibit synergistically enhanced antioxidant capabilities in pro-inflammatory macrophages and alleviates osteoporotic bone loss by restoring mitochondrial respiratory chain complex function, remodeling DNA and histone modifications, and thereby restoring osteoimmune homeostasis. Overall, these findings highlight the compelling dual treatment mechanisms of MOCT NPs, providing a theoretical basis for the management of osteoporosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007058465

Previous studies have primarily focused on circulating B cells in the blood, with limited investigation of tumor-infiltrating B cells (TIL-Bs) and their secreted antibodies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissue. This study aimed to clarify TIL-Bs’ role in HNSCC through comprehensive analyses including single-cell RNA sequencing of 68 cases, B-cell receptor repertoire analysis, multiplex immunofluorescence staining, and spatial transcriptomics analysis of resected HNSCC specimens. We identified CXCL13+CD4+ T cells that attract B cells, along with TIL-Bs at various differentiation stages, showing clonal expansion of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). These ASCs exhibited a low somatic hypermutation frequency, indicating that they are likely activated through extrafollicular response rather than germinal center response. Protein microarrays with recombinant antibodies mimicking TIL-Bs secretory antibodies and serum antibodies revealed several antigens highly expressed in tumor cells. These antigens demonstrated higher expression in tumor cells than normal epithelial cells in the resected HNSCC specimens. Tissue analysis indicated that antibodies binding to these antigens are recognized by macrophage and NK cells with Fc receptors, potentially enhancing tumor immunity. The existence of tumor-infiltrating ASCs showed correlation with favorable prognosis. This study demonstrated for the first time that expanded TIL-Bs produce antibodies and likely contribute to tumor elimination by activating tumor immunity in HNSCC tissues.

Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is the primary pathogenic bacterium of periodontitis. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) derived from P. gingivalis (P.g-OMVs) contain various bioactive molecules, and several studies have suggested that P.g-OMVs may participate in alveolar bone loss caused by periodontitis. Materials and Methods: P.g-OMVs were isolated and characterized. The effect of P.g-OMVs on BMSCs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation was analyzed. High-throughput sequencing, RT-qPCR, and Western blot analysis were performed in BMSCs to unravel the underlying molecular mechanism. Results: P.g-OMVs promoted proliferation but inhibited osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. High-throughput sequencing results showed that serum amyloid A (SAA), especially SAA3, was robustly upregulated in P.g-OMVs-treated BMSCs. Upregulated SAA3 promoted TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 and inhibited osteogenic differentiation of P.g-OMVs-treated BMSCs. The knockdown of SAA3 in BMSCs downregulated P.g-OMVs-induced TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 and rescued P.g-OMVs-inhibited osteogenic differentiation. Conclusions: Our results indicate that P.g-OMVs inhibit osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via the SAA3-mediated TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB axis, providing novel targets for the treatment of periodontitis-induced alveolar bone loss. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012972576

Patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes, malignancy, and chronic liver disease are particularly vulnerable. Dysregulated macrophage polarization plays a pivotal role in sepsis progression. Although exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key immune modulators, the precise role of plasma-derived exosomal miR-17-5p in this process remains poorly defined. The transcription factor Bcl11b, previously linked to immune cell regulation, has not yet been studied in the context of sepsis-associated macrophage reprogramming. Methods: Extracellular vehicles (EVs) were isolated from the plasma of sepsis patients and healthy controls. A series of in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of exosomal miR-17-5p on macrophage polarization, using qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, ELISA, and Western blot analyses. Transcriptome sequencing and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to explore the regulatory relationship between miR-17-5p and Bcl11b. Results: Plasma exosomes derived from sepsis patients exhibited reduced levels of miR-17-5p and promoted M1 macrophage polarization, characterized by increased iNOS and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Overexpression of miR-17-5p inhibited M1 polarization and alleviated inflammatory injury both in LPS-treated macrophages and in a CLP-induced mouse model. Mechanistically, miR-17-5p directly targeted the 3′UTR of Bcl11b, suppressing its expression. Restoration of Bcl11b reversed the anti-inflammatory effects of miR-17-5p, reinforcing M1 polarization and exacerbating lung injury. Conclusion: Plasma exosomal miR-17-5p promotes macrophage M1 polarization by targeting Bcl11b and contributes to sepsis-induced lung injury. These findings highlight a previously unrecognized miR-17-5p–Bcl11b regulatory axis and suggest a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for sepsis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012941982

This study aimed to identify key immune-related genes (IRGs) driving T cell-mediated responses in SILI and evaluate their diagnostic potential. Methods: Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was performed to establish a murine sepsis model (n=7/group), with sham-operated controls. Serum IL-1β and lactate levels were quantified via ELISA. Public transcriptomic datasets (GSE26440, GSE26378, GSE25504, GSE28750; 180 sepsis vs 53 controls) were analyzed to identify differentially expressed IRGs (DEIRGs). Functional enrichment (GO/KEGG), protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) were integrated to prioritize T cell-associated genes. Flow cytometry assessed immune cell subsets (CD3+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, NK1.1+ NK cells, F4/80+ macrophages) in murine blood. Liver histopathology (HE staining) and cytokine expression (IL-1β/TNF-α; IHC) were evaluated. Results: CLP mice exhibited elevated IL-1β (P<0.01) and lactate (P<0.01), confirming metabolic dysfunction and inflammation. Bioinformatics analysis identified 19 DEIRGs, with PPI networks implicating immune regulation (PPI enrichment p=3.35×10-6). Flow cytometry confirmed T cell dominance (65.87% vs 63.85% in controls). scRNA-seq revealed four T cell-linked hub genes (FCER1G, IL2RB, PTGDR, XCL1). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis demonstrated that these genes form a synergistic regulatory network involving NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and other key pathways, with notable features including the IL2RB-XCL1 positive feedback loop and the opposing effects of PTGDR isoforms (DP1/DP2). Histopathology showed hepatic necrosis and inflammatory infiltration, correlating with upregulated IL-1β/TNF-α (IHC, P<0.05).

Although different risk factors condition the evolution and outcome of CVDs, a limited number of common pathological pathways converge in adverse cardiac remodeling. Among these, cardiac fibrosis has been postulated not only as a mechanism for the onset and development of CVDs but also as a predictor of disease severity. Tools to diagnose subclinical cardiac fibrosis and therapies targeting cardiac fibrosis constitute an essential line of research in CVDs. To date, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive tool for diagnosing cardiac fibrosis, but sampling errors can occur. Moreover, its availability is limited by the high cost of the equipment. For this reason, nanotechnology offers a promising approach for developing nanosystems directed at molecular targets of cardiac damage, to provide both affordable and readily available diagnostics and the possibility of targeted therapy. This review will showcase major research advances on the role of nanoparticles in cardiac fibrosis. It will discuss the advantages and limitations of nanoparticles, and the standards for advancing them to the clinical phase of treatment and diagnosis of cardiac fibrosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012742012

Current clinical treatments for alopecia include medication, hair transplantation, low-level light therapy, and stem cell therapy, among others. However, the effectiveness of these treatments remains far from ideal. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, yet challenges, such as mass production and clinical application persist. This review aims to explore recent advancements in the use of EVs for the treatment of alopecia. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the PubMed database using a range of relevant keywords: extracellular vesicles, alopecia, hair loss, preparation, exosomes, microvesicles, apoptotic bodies, nanoscale particles, preclinical studies, clinical trial, clinical transformation, regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, stem cell, bioactive molecules, and extraction methods. The papers mostly focus on the biological characteristics and preparation of EVs, the basic and clinical research of EVs in the treatment of hair loss, and the challenges of clinical transformation of EVs were retracted. Results: EVs are nanoscale, spherical particles enclosed by a lipid bilayer. They exert their effects by activating signaling pathways through ligand binding or by entering cells via membrane fusion or endocytosis. Compared to traditional medications or stem cell therapies, EVs offer several advantages, including high biological safety, sustained efficacy, low risk of immune rejection, and ease of storage and transportation. These properties make them a highly promising therapeutic option. Conclusion: Significant progress has been made in understanding the preparation, mechanisms, and early clinical applications of EVs. However, further research is needed to optimize key factors, such as dosing, cell sources, and administration frequency to develop more effective and safer therapies. With continued innovation in manufacturing technologies and collaborative efforts between academia and industry, EVs hold great potential for advancing clinical treatments for alopecia in the future. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012733626

The abundance of these haematopoietic stem cell-derived adipocytes (HSCDAs) is elevated in female mice by ovariectomy (OVX) or oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα) knockdown, suggesting that they may be involved in the metabolic and inflammatory pathology that accompany the loss of oestrogen signalling. However, we previously demonstrated that ablation of HSCDAs elevated circulating leptin levels while suppressing physical activity and insulin sensitivity. Here, we tested the combined impact of OVX with and without HSCDA ablation. We discovered that HSCDA depletion plus OVX raised circulating leptin levels more than HSCDA depletion alone. Likewise, while HSCDA depletion or OVX alone inhibited physical activity and insulin responsiveness, their combination further suppressed these endpoints. Other physiologic endpoints were regulated by OVX alone. We conclude that HSCDAs play a role inthe maintenance of a subset of metabolic endpoints related to normal adipose tissue function, and their elevated production in models of female sex hormone suppression occurs to normalize these endpoints. The results highlight the ability of HSCDAs to target physical activity and insulin responsiveness, possibly by normalizing leptin production. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012616714

Despite its significance, healthcare students often feel underprepared to manage agitation, citing fear, stigma, and limited clinical exposure. Traditional teaching methods, such as lectures or simulations, are resource-intensive and offer limited opportunities for repeated practice in low-risk environments. Virtual reality (VR) offers a promising alternative, providing immersive, standardised, and repeatable training for high-stress clinical scenarios. In response, the education team at [redacted for peer review], developed the Managing AGgression using Immersive Content (MAGIC) programme. This three-hour blended learning workshop, a mandatory component of the psychiatry curriculum for medical and nursing students, integrates didactic teaching, role-play, and the Virtual Reality in Agitation Management (VRAM) activity. Through experiential learning, MAGIC aims to enhance healthcare students’ confidence, empathy, mental health literacy, and competence in managing agitation in psychiatric healthcare settings. Using a pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design, we evaluated the programme’s effectiveness among 152 medical and nursing students. Results demonstrated significant improvements in mental health literacy, self-perceived proficiency, and confidence in managing agitated patients; there was also a marked reduction in stigma towards individuals with mental health conditions. In addition, participants responded positively to all aspects of the VRAM software, underscoring its usability and educational value. These findings highlight the potential of integrating immersive VR technology with traditional pedagogical methods to transform healthcare education by fostering deeper engagement, enhancing clinical competence, and ultimately improving patient outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012609657

Methods: We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to evaluate causal relationships of POI with immune cell traits (CD4+ regulatory T cell [Treg], and its subtype CD39 + CD4+ Treg, CD33 expression) and lipid metabolism markers (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] and intermediate-density lipoprotein [IDL] subfractions). Genetic instruments were derived from three independent sources: immune cell data from 3,757 Sardinians, lipid traits from 21,559 Europeans, and POI cases (N = 655) with population-matched controls (N = 267,780) from FinnGen R12. Primary causal estimates were generated using inverse-variance weighted regression, complemented by sensitivity analyses (MR-Egger, MR-PRESSO). Results: CD39+ Treg subpopulations showed robust protection against POI in proportional analyses: secreting (%CD4 Treg: OR = 0.889, p = 0.015), activated (%CD4 Treg: OR = 0.881, p = 0.021). CD39+ resting Treg absolute count was significant (OR = 0.861, p = 0.027), while CD39 expression on activated/secreting Treg reduced risk (OR = 0.917–0.904, p < 0.05). Elevated CD33 expression on 9 of 12 myeloid cell subsets (e.g. granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor Cells, CD33+ monocytes), and plasma CD33 protein (OR = 0.877, p = 0.030) were inversely associated with POI risk. Dyslipidemia traits demonstrated causal associations: total cholesterol (OR = 1.328, p = 0.028), large LDL-free cholesterol (OR = 1.28, p = 0.030), and IDL components—total cholesterol, free cholesterol, phospholipids, particle concentration, and total lipids (OR = 1.287–1.345, all p < 0.05).

Methods: UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis was employed to identify the absorbed constituents from KXD in mice blood. cTnTR141W transgenic mice were given with KXD via gavage for 4 weeks. Cardiac remodeling was evaluated by echocardiography, heart weight index, H&E staining, Masson staining, and WGA staining. The potential therapeutic target of KXD was identified through RNA sequencing. H9c2 cells were stimulated with DOX and KXD in vitro. Tunel staining, Immunofluorescence, Transmission electron microscopy, qRT-PCR, and Western blot were used to evaluate cardiomyocyte apoptosis and gap junction remodeling. Results: 11 compounds from KXD were identified in the blood. KXD improved cardiac dysfunction and alleviated interstitial fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in cTnTR141W transgenic mice. The mechanistic investigations of RNA sequencing revealed that regulating apoptosis and gap junctions may be potential processes for KXD.

While apoptotic derivatives of stem cells hold promise for regenerative therapy, their role in modulating angiogenesis within the diabetic wound microenvironment remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate whether adipose stem cell-derived apoptotic vesicles (ASCs-apoVs) promote angiogenesis and accelerate diabetic wound healing by inhibiting endothelial cell ferroptosis. Methods: Diabetic mice model was established by feeding with high-fat diet (HFD) for 3 months followed by full-thickness skin wound preparation. Adipose stem cells (ASCs) isolated from adipose tissue were treated with staurosporine (STS) to induce apoptosis in vitro. Apoptotic vesicles (apoVs) were isolated by differential centrifugation, characterized using TEM, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Western blot, and applied topically to diabetic wounds. The therapeutic effects of apoVs on wound healing efficiency, vascularization level and endothelial cell ferroptosis were evaluated. Results: HFD-induced diabetes promoted lipid peroxidation (4HNE accumulation) and ferroptosis in endothelial cells (ECs), leading to reduced CD31+ and vWf+ vessel density and delayed wound closure. In vitro diabetic endothelial cell models confirmed increased lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, which compromised the proliferation, migration and tube formation capacities of ECs. ASCs-apoVs, characterized by typical extracellular vesicle (EV) morphology and apoptotic markers, significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis of ECs, thereby promoting angiogenesis and accelerating diabetic wound healing. Conclusion: Ferroptosis of endothelial cells contributes to impaired vascularization in diabetic wounds. ApoVs represent a promising cell-free therapeutic approach to mitigate ferroptosis, restore endothelial function and promote angiogenesis, offering a potential strategy for diabetic wound management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012588276

This study aimed to explore the temporal dynamics and key regulatory genes of NET formation in SCI to identify therapeutic targets. Methods: We integrated two transcriptomic datasets from the GEO database to identify differentially expressed NETs-related genes (NRGs) in SCI. WGCNA identified SCI-related modules, while GSVA assessed NET formation dynamics. Publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GEO database determined cell-specific expression patterns of key NRGs. Findings were validated through immunofluorescence, Western blot, and qPCR in a mouse SCI model. Regulatory networks were constructed, and potential therapeutic compounds were predicted using DSigDB and molecular docking. Results: We identified seven key NRGs (Casp1, Ccl3, Fcgr2b, Itgam, Itgb2, Tlr2, Tlr4) in SCI. GSVA revealed peak NET score at day 1 post-injury, with attenuation at days 3 and 7. Single-cell transcriptome analysis demonstrated predominant expression of these key genes in neutrophils during the acute phase, most prominently at 1 day post-injury, which coincides with the most pronounced neutrophil infiltration. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses confirmed significantly elevated NET formation at 1 day post-SCI. qPCR verified the expression of all key NRGs. Regulatory network analysis identified CHD1 as an important transcription factor governing NET formation, while miRNA-mRNA network construction revealed sophisticated post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms.

As the primary driver of human mobility and metabolic health, skeletal muscle loss diminishes quality of life and increases healthcare burden. Atrophy impairs recovery and prognosis by reducing metabolic capacity, accelerating systemic protein catabolism, and compromising the biomechanical support necessary for movement and respiration. Although core molecular pathways and cellular changes are well characterized, the role of mechanical cues in modulating these mechanisms remains underexplored. Main Findings: Our review reveals five convergent atrophy drivers—mechanical unloading, ECM alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction/oxidative stress, inflammation, and endocrine imbalance—that converge on inhibited mTORC1 signaling, activated FoxO/UPS/autophagy, and impaired satellite‐cell function. Quantitative data show that axial stretch preserves PI3K/Akt/mTOR activity, with phosphorylated Akt levels increasing by two‐ to three‐fold and fiber cross‐sectional area expanding by 10%–20%; low‐intensity compression activates AMPK and autophagy, with AMPK phosphorylation rising by 1.5‐fold without triggering excessive protein breakdown; and shear stress enhances VEGF and Nrf2‐mediated angiogenesis and antioxidant defenses, doubling VEGF expression and reducing ROS levels by 25% to mitigate neurogenic atrophy. Moreover, stem‐cell myogenic differentiation is optimized on 3D biomimetic substrates with stiffness from 11 to 17 kPa under physiological loading, and advances in biomaterials and tissue engineering enable more accurate muscle‐tissue models. Future Directions: Translating these biomechanical insights into tailored clinical interventions—combining stretch, compression, and shear modalities with biomaterials, stem-cell technologies, and personalized exercise programs— holds promise for preventing and reversing muscle atrophy across diverse patient populations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105012428559

However, the pathogenesis of HIRI has not been fully elucidated, and prevention and treatment strategies remain challenging. Methods: A mouse model of HIRI was established, and schisandrin B (Sch B) was used to intervene in HIRI. The effect of Sch B on HIRI was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Western blot (WB), immunohistochemistry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The expression of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the serum of the HIRI mouse model was significantly increased, indicating the successful construction of the HIRI mouse model. In the Sch B intervention group, serum ALT and AST levels were significantly decreased. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and qPCR results demonstrated that Sch B could reduce HIRI in mice. The qPCR and immunohistochemistry showed that Sch B reduced HIRI in mice by decreasing the expression of autophagy-related factors Beclin-1 and LC3-II. Conclusions: Additionally, qPCR and immunohistochemical results indicated that Sch B reduced HIRI by decreasing the expression of autophagy-related factors (Beclin-1 and LC3-II) and hepatocyte damage-related factors (caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax), thereby reducing HIRI in mice. The results of electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and qPCR confirmed that Sch B could reduce autophagy and alleviate HIRI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105004695182

Nevertheless, given the extensive range of sources and variegated existence of stem cells in diverse tissues, certain disparities prevail in their biological characteristics and functions. In this paper, the therapeutic efficacies of dissimilar sources of mesenchymal stem cells on animal models of premature ovarian failure were contrasted, with the aim of providing a basis for the clinical application of stem cells. METHODS: The animal model experiments of mesenchymal stem cell therapy for premature ovarian failure were retrieved from PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and EMbase, as well as Chinese databases such as CNKI, WanFang, VIP, and China Biomedical Literature Service. The search period extended from the inception to December 31, 2023. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted and analyzed the data. The quality of the included studies was evaluated by means of the SYRCLE animal experiment bias risk assessment table. Main outcome measures: Follicle stimulating hormone, estradiol, luteinizing hormone, the quantity of follicles at all levels. Secondary outcome measure: Pregnancy rate. Network meta-analysis, mapping, and tabulation were executed using Stata 17.0 software after assessing the risk of bias in the included studies. RESULTS: Totally 24 animal experiment studies were incorporated, and the overall quality of the literature was mediocre, encompassing 7 distinct sources of mesenchymal stem cells. They were umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells, menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells, placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells, human cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and amnio-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The network meta-analysis demonstrated that (1) in contrast to the blank group, mesenchymal stem cells from various sources were effective in enhancing the pregnancy rate and estradiol, reducing follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, augmenting the number of follicles at all levels, and diminishing the number of atretic follicles. (2) According to the area map under the cumulative sequencing curve, the three stem cells with the most prominent efficacy in improving estradiol levels were umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (72.7%) > adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (72.6%) > menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (71.7%). (3) The three kinds of stem cells with the highest efficacy in reducing follicle-stimulating hormone levels were the adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (96.3%) > human cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (65.4%) > umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (63.9%). (4) The three kinds of stem cells with the highest efficacy in reducing luteinizing hormone levels were adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (100.0%) > umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (51.6%) > human cord bloodderived mesenchymal stem cells (46.8%). (5) The top three kinds of stem cells for increasing the number of primordial follicles were human cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (76.3%) > umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (75.5%) > menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (57.5%). (6) The top three kinds of stem cells for increasing the number of primary follicles were umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (75.3%) > adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (53.0%) > the placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (51.7%). (7) The top three kinds of stem cells for increasing the number of secondary follicles were adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (76.1%) > menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (66.8%) > umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (66.5%). (8) The top three kinds of stem cells in reducing the number of atretic follicles were adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (99.9%) > bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (68.1%) > umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (53.4%). CONCLUSION: (1) For animal models of premature ovarian failure, the results of the network meta-analysis disclosed that various stem cell transplantation treatments were preponderant over the blank or placebo group to varying extents, and the efficacies were comparable. (2) The results indicated that umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells were the most frequently utilized and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells were the most potent.

However, the role and mechanism of exosome-derived genes in cartilage degeneration of osteoarthritis have not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: Bioinformatics analyses were used to screen the genes related to cartilage degeneration in the synovial exosomes of patients with osteoarthritis, and to determine their biological functions and signaling pathways in order to provide new therapeutic targets for delaying cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis. METHODS: Firstly, osteoarthritis-related exosome dataset GSE185059 and cartilage degeneration dataset GSE114007 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to screen exosome-derived cartilage degeneration related genes. GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed based on the screened exosome-derived cartilage degeneration related genes. Protein-protein interaction network was drawn and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was conducted to screen and obtain key exosome-derived cartilage degeneration-related genes. Finally, qRT-PCR was used to verify the expression of key genes in osteoarthritis cartilage tissue and interleukin-1β stimulated chondrocyte models. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) There were 831 differentially expressed genes in the GSE185059 dataset and 5 323 differentially expressed genes in the GSE114007 dataset. A total of 94 exosome-derived cartilage degeneration related genes were screened after the intersection of these differentially expressed genes, of which 51 genes were down-regulated and 43 genes were up-regulated. (2) GO functional enrichment analysis showed that the up-regulated genes were mainly involved in the positive regulation of cell-cell adhesion, the positive regulation of T cell activation, and chronic inflammatory response, while the down-regulated genes were mainly involved in biological processes such as cell aggregation, cartilage differentiation and development, and skeletal system morphogenesis. (3) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that exosome-derived cartilage degeneration-related genes were mainly involved in tryptophan enrichment metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, and leukocyte transendothelial migration. (4) The constructed protein-protein interaction network confirmed the existence of multiple interaction relationships among exosome-derived cartilage degeneration-related genes. Combined with five algorithms in CytoHubba software, four key exosome-derived cartilage degeneration-related genes were further screened, namely THY1, CYP1A1, NFKB2, and COL6A3. (5) The results of qRT-PCR showed that compared with normal cartilage, the expressions of THY1 and COL6A3 in osteoarthritic cartilage were increased, while the expression of CYP1A1 and NFKB2 was decreased. Similarly, compared with the unstimulated group, the expression of THY1 and COL6A3 in the interleukin-1β induced chondrocytes was upregulated, while the expression of CYP1A1 and NFKB2 was downregulated. (6) These results indicate that THY1, CYP1A1, NFKB2, and COL6A3 are genes related to cartilage degeneration in the exosomes of synovial fluid of patients with osteoarthritis, and may participate in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis by regulating biological processes such as protein tyrosine kinase activity and lipid metabolism, as well as nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway and focal adhesion signaling pathway. However, the specific regulatory roles and molecular mechanisms of these key genes in cartilage degeneration need to be further verified by experiments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002239281

Thus, identifying bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell subpopulations with enhanced osteogenic potential is of significant importance for advancing bone tissue engineering. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the osteogenic differentiation potential differences between STRO-1 positive and negative bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells under osteogenic induction conditions. METHODS: SD rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and cultured. The expression of CD29, CD45, CD90, and STRO-1 was identified via flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Immunomagnetic cell sorting was used to separate STRO-1 positive and negative bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. The cells of two groups were subjected to osteogenic induction for 7 and 14 days. qRT-PCR and western blotting were performed to analyze differences in osteogenesis-related gene expression (Collagen I, Runt-related transcription factor 2, osteoprotegerin, and osteocalcin) and protein levels. Alizarin red staining and alkaline phosphatase staining were used to observe calcium nodule formation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Flow cytometry showed high expression levels of CD29 and CD90 and low expression of CD45, with a positive STRO-1 expression rate of 12.8%. Immunofluorescence results were consistent with those of flow cytometry. After magnetic cell sorting, STRO-1 positive cells demonstrated a higher colony formation rate than STRO-1 negative cells. On day 14, STRO-1 positive cells showed significantly higher osteogenic differentiation potential than on day 7, with significantly elevated osteogenesis-related marker levels compared to STRO-1 negative cells (P < 0.01). The findings indicate that STRO-1 positive bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells exhibit significant advantages in osteogenic potential, providing a theoretical basis for their selection as ideal seed cells in bone tissue engineering.

Previous studies by the research team have demonstrated that human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells overexpressing erythropoietin (EPO-MSCs) under ischemic and hypoxic conditions have better neuroprotective functions and significantly activate the expression of LncRNA XIST. Research suggests that XIST is related to the pathogenesis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, but the role and mechanism of its regulation by EPO-MSCs in protecting ischemic-hypoxic neurons remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To explore the new mechanism by which LncRNA XIST, in response to EPO-MSC signaling, affects the apoptosis of ischemic-hypoxic SH-SY5Y cells. METHODS: (1) SH-SY5Y cell lines with knockdown of LncRNA XIST (sh-XIST) and negative control (NC-XIST) were constructed through lentiviral transfection. Oxygen-glucose deprivation was used to induce ischemic-hypoxic injury in the cells. Transwell chambers were used to create a non-contact co-culture system with EPO-MSCs, sh-XIST, and NC-XIST ischemic-hypoxic SH-SY5Y cells. Cell proliferation ability was detected using the CCK-8 assay. Cell migration ability was assessed using the scratch assay, and cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. (2) RNA-seq bioinformatics analysis was performed to screen for differentially expressed genes and pathways between sh-XIST and NC-XIST cell lines. Dual-luciferase experiments were used to verify the relationship between miR-124-3p and the target genes XIST and GRIN1. qRT-PCR was conducted to validate the expression levels of downstream miR-124-3p and GRIN1 genes. (3) miR-124-3p inhibitors and mimics were added to verify phenotypic changes in SH-SY5Y cells after ischemic-hypoxic injury and co-culture with EPO-MSCs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Compared with the NC-XIST group, SH-SY5Y cells in the sh-XIST group showed reduced proliferation and migration abilities and increased apoptosis after ischemic-hypoxic injury and co-culture with EPO-MSCs. (2) Dual-luciferase experiments showed that miR-124-3p interacted with the target gene XIST. SH-SY5Y cells transfected with miR-124-3p mimics and co-cultured with EPO-MSCs showed decreased apoptosis after ischemic-hypoxic injury, while SH-SY5Y cells transfected with miR-124-3p inhibitors showed increased apoptosis after co-culture with EPO-MSCs. (3) Transcriptomic sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of sh-XIST revealed significant downregulation of the neuroactive ligand-receptor pathway and the key receptor gene GRIN1 for central nervous system development. (4) Dual-luciferase experiments showed that miR-124-3p interacted with GRIN1. GRIN1 expression was significantly downregulated in the sh-XIST group after ischemic-hypoxic injury compared with the NC-XIST group. These findings indicate that LncRNA XIST promotes GRIN1 expression by upregulating miR-124-3p, thereby reducing cell apoptosis after ischemic-hypoxic injury and co-culture with EPO-MSCs and enhancing proliferation and migration. sh-XIST can block this protective function. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105002079731

Cryoprotective agents often contain dimethyl sulfoxide and serum. To avoid the toxic side effects of dimethyl sulfoxide, the complexity of serum components and immune responses, although some finished cryoprotective agents have been marketed, they are faced with many difficulties such as high cost and limited application. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a cryoprotective agent with clear components and the ability to solve the above problems. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a novel cryoprotectant on cryopreservation efficiency of different tissue and cell sources. METHODS: By applying the novel cryoprotectant as an experimental group with the commercially available and widely used cryoprotectant (control group) to umbilical cord Wharton’s jelly tissue, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells, umbilical cord blood/peripheral blood mononuclear cells, NK and CIK cells, comparative analyses were conducted in terms of cell morphology, number, viability, surface markers, differentiation potential, and cell-killing toxicity assay before cryopreservation and after resuscitation thawing. We confirmed the cryopreservation effect of the new cryoprotectant and its potential application value. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) The novel cryoprotectant facilitated the normal growth of cryopreserved Wharton’s jelly tissue upon recovery, exhibiting mesenchymal stem cell morphology. No significant differences were observed between the experimental and control groups in terms of cell recovery rate, surface markers, and differentiation potential. (2) There was no significant difference in the number and viability of cells between the experimental group and the control group after cryopreservation of cord blood/peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the cryo-resuscitated cell numbers and viability of derived NK cells/CIK cells did not show significant difference between the experimental and control groups. (3) For NK cells derived and differentiated from cord blood/ peripheral blood mononuclear cells, there was no significant difference in the proportion of CD56+CD16+ cell subpopulations between the experimental group and the control group. For CIK cells derived and differentiated from cord blood/peripheral blood mononuclear cells, there was no significant difference in the proportions of CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD56+ cell subpopulations between the experimental group and the control group.

With the increase of age, the regenerative ability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells is weakened and the differentiation function is impaired, leading to poor osteoporosis. Therefore, restoring the regenerative capacity and cellular function of aged bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells is essential for the effective treatment of osteoporosis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of passage 3 and passage 11 bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes of young rats on the aging of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells derived from elderly rats. METHODS: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from 6-8-week-old female SD rats were isolated and cultured, and passaged to the passages 3 and 11, respectively. Then, exosomes from passages 3 and 11 bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were extracted. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from 18-month-old female SD rats were isolated and cultured, passaged to passage 3, and divided into 3 groups. The control group was routinely cultured, and the other two groups were intervened with exosomes from passages 3 and 11 bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. After 48 hours of exosome intervention, the expression of β-galactosidase in the nucleus was detected by β-galactosidase staining kit. The expression of aging-related genes was detected by qRT-PCR. The expression differences of miRNA in exosomes from passages 3 and 11 bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were compared by Small RNA sequencing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Compared with the control group and passage 11 bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes group, the β-galactosidase activity of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells of aged rats was significantly lower in the passage 3 bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes group. (2) Compared with the control group, the expression of aging-related genes p21 and p16 was significantly reduced in the passage 3 bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosome group (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference in the expression of aging-related genes p21 and p16 in the passage 11 bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosome group. (3) Sequencing results showed that there was a significant difference in the expression of miRNAs in the two exosomes, among which the miRNAs with the most significant expression differences were let-7c-5p, let-7b-5p, miR-320-3p, and miR-26a-5p. KEGG analysis results showed that significantly different miRNA enrichment pathways include mTOR, AMPK and other aging-related signaling pathways. The above results indicate that passage 3 bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes have the ability to reverse the aging of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in aged rats. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105001877951

OBJECTIVE: To study the controlling impact of exosomes from metformin-altered bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells on chondrocytes. METHODS: Rabbit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and chondrocytes were cultured in vitro. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells derived exosomes and metformin pretreated bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells derived exosomes were collected using a high-speed centrifuge. Chondrocytes were cultured with exosome-containing culture medium for 24 hours and then treated with 100 µmol/L H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> for 24 hours. The capability changes of two extracellular vesicles on chondrocyte proliferation and migration were detected using CCK8 assay and scratch healing experiment, respectively. Western blot analysis and RT-qPCR were employed to examine the alterations in the expression of type II collagen, P16 protein, and their mRNA in chondrocytes. Western blot analysis was utilized to assess the changes in the expression of MKK7/JNK pathway proteins. ELISA kits were utilized to measure the activity of cell superoxide dismutase and the levels of malondialdehyde in chondrocytes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) In an oxidative stress environment, the proliferation and migration abilities of chondrocytes were weakened. The two types of exosomes could restore the proliferation and migration abilities of chondrocytes to a certain extent. Metformin pretreated bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells derived exosomes had a significantly better improvement effect (P < 0.05). (2) Compared with normal bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes, metformin pretreated bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells derived exosomes could more effectively increase type II collagen expression and superoxide dismutase activity (P < 0.05), and were also more effective in reducing P16 expression and malondialdehyde levels (P < 0.05). (3) The two types of exosomes could inhibit the expression of MKK7 and p-JNK proteins to a certain extent, and the inhibitory effect of metformin pretreated bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells derived exosomes was more significant (P < 0.05).

Simultaneously, it can accelerate the mineralization process of periodontal ligament stem cells and reduce oxidative stress damage. However, the mechanism of action on osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect and action mechanism of erythropoietin/erythropoietin receptor signaling pathway on osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells. METHODS: Enzyme digestion method was used to isolate and culture periodontal ligament stem cells from periodontal disease patients and healthy people. The mRNA and protein levels of erythropoietin receptor in two kinds of periodontal ligament stem cells were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot assay. Erythropoietin receptor expression was silenced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or activated by erythropoietin. qRT-PCR and western blot assay were used to detect the expression of erythropoietin receptor, levels of osteogenic marker genes Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osteocalcin, osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein. Alkaline phosphatase staining and alizarin red staining were applied to measure osteogenic differentiation ability of periodontal ligament stem cells. The phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) was detected by western blot assay. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) The results of qRT-PCR and western blot assay showed that the mRNA and protein levels of erythropoietin receptor in periodontal ligament stem cells in the disease group were significantly lower than those in periodontal ligament stem cells in the healthy group. (2) Alkaline phosphatase staining and alizarin red staining showed that knocking down the erythropoietin receptor can inhibit the osteogenic differentiation ability of periodontal ligament stem cells. qRT-PCR results showed that compared with the control group, knockdown of the erythropoietin receptor group significantly reduced expression levels of Runt-related transcription factor 2, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein (P < 0.05). (3) qRT-PCR results showed that after erythropoietin treatment, the expression of erythropoietin receptor in periodontal ligament stem cells recovered. Silencing erythropoietin receptor and then administration of erythropoietin treatment reversed the expression level of erythropoietin receptor. Erythropoietin treatment increased the osteogenic differentiation ability of periodontal ligament stem cells in the disease group and the expression level of the osteogenic marker gene Runt-related transcription factor 2 (P < 0.05). Silencing the expression of STAT5 inhibited this effect of erythropoietin. (4) Western blot assay results showed that with the extension of erythropoietin treatment time, the phosphorylation level of STAT5 increased in periodontal ligament stem cells in the disease group (P < 0.05).

Notably, ectoderm-derived jaw bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells have stronger proliferation and osteogenic differentiation capacity compared with mesoderm-derived iliac bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, elucidating the key mechanisms involved. It is expected to provide a new strategy for the repair of craniomaxillofacial bone defects. OBJECTIVE: To compare the biological differences between human jaw bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and iliac bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and identify the key regulatory genes. METHODS: (1) Jaw bone and iliac bone were collected from three patients with alveolar cleft. Primary bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and cultured. Cell proliferation ability was detected by colony formation assay. Cell senescence was detected by β-galactosidase staining assay. Senescence and osteogenesis-related protein expression levels were detected by western blot assay. Osteogenic ability was detected by alizarin red staining after osteogenic induction solution treatment. (2) Jaw bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and iliac bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were subjected to transcriptome and differential gene expression analysis to find the 20 genes with the largest differential expression and identify the key regulatory factors. (3) The gene in iliac bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were knocked down to comparatively analyze the changes in self-renewal, anti-aging and osteogenic capacity of iliac bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. (4) The gene-edited iliac bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were loaded into β-tricalcium phosphate scaffolds and implant into nude mice for 8 weeks. The scaffolds were stained with Masson staining and immunofluorescence staining to observe the difference in osteogenic capacity. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Jaw bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells have stronger proliferation, anti-aging and osteogenic differentiation abilities compared to iliac bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. (2) By transcriptome analysis, we identified HOXA10 as a highly up-regulated core transcription factor in iliac bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. (3) After knocking down HOXA10 in iliac bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, we observed a significant increase in proliferation, anti-aging, and osteogenic differentiation abilities. (4) After HOXA10 knocked-down iliac bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells/β-tricalcium phosphate was implanted subcutaneously on the back of nude mice, and their bone formation ability was stronger. (5) The above results suggest that HOXA10 is a key regulatory gene that determines the proliferative, anti-aging and osteogenic differentiation abilities of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.

Although guidelines for managing CTD-associated ILD (CTD-ILD) exist, many patients respond poorly to treatment owing to two key factors: (1) incomplete understanding of subtype-specific pathogenic mechanisms, and (2) reliance on therapies adapted from systemic sclerosis or nonpulmonary rheumatic diseases, which fail to address the unique pathophysiology of distinct CTD-ILD subtypes. This hinders personalized treatment and underscores the need for robust preclinical models that accurately replicate disease-specific mechanisms. However, challenges remain: (1) the lack of models that fully capture the heterogeneity of these disorders and (2) the absence of systematic structured reviews to guide model selection, despite recent advancements in experimental methodologies. These issues often result in mismatches between research goals and model utility. This review summarizes current CTD-ILD animal models, focusing on their construction, characteristics, and limitations, and highlighting differences between each model and the corresponding human disease. We summarize these disparities and propose emerging technologies, including CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, humanized mice, and lung organoids/lung-on-a-chip systems, that may facilitate the development of next-generation models. By integrating established and emerging strategies, we aim to provide guidance for model selection and development, promote precision modeling, accelerate targeted therapy discovery, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.

Despite their distinct etiology and progression, emerging evidence suggests that calcium signaling plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of both diseases by influencing a variety of cellular processes within joint tissues. Calcium is essential for regulating key cellular functions, including gene expression, muscle contraction, cell cycle progression, proliferation, apoptosis, excitation-contraction coupling, synaptic transmission, and embryonic development. Particularly, in the context of arthritic diseases, an imbalance in calcium homeostasis has significant consequences, since the osteogenic and chondrogenic processes, as well as extracellular matrix formation, are highly influenced by calcium levels. Given these insights, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing calcium uptake, release, and metabolism could enhance our comprehension of disease pathogenesis and facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

SSc pathogenesis involves both genetic and environmental factors, such as silica dust or benzene exposure but the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating fibrogenesis and organ involvement are not fully understood. In part due to this knowledge gap, treatment options are limited. In this review we look at the possible role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a transcription factor involved in immunomodulation, fibrosis and drug metabolism and inflammatory responses, especially in barrier organs. AHR activation by binding to one of its many small molecular weight ligands can result in gene-expression changes in the nucleus (its role as a transcription factor) but also lead to knock-on effects on other signaling pathways via direct binding (e.g., to NFkB) or via AHR's protein degradation capacity (E3 ligase). In some cell types transcription target genes include the fibrogenic cytokine TGF-β or metalloproteinases responsible for extracellular matrix remodeling. AHR has been shown to be highly expressed in all cutaneous cell populations, and to be critical for skin homeostasis. Given its context-dependent effects, AHR may act as both a pro- and anti-fibrotic regulator in SSc, depending on ligand availability and cellular environment. This dual role highlights AHR as a potential therapeutic target, where selective agonists or antagonists could help restore immune and fibrotic homeostasis. Here, we explore these mechanisms and discuss the potential of AHR as a therapeutic target for modulating disease progression and improving patient outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014114174

Recent advances have implicated gut microbiota dysbiosis in RA pathophysiology, with evidence spanning mechanistic, diagnostic, and therapeutic dimensions. This review summarizes current knowledge of the gut-joint axis and outlines microbiota-based strategies for RA management. Numerous studies have demonstrated consistent alterations in gut microbial communities in patients with RA, with enrichment of Prevotella copri observed in 75% of patients with new-onset RA compared to 21.4% of healthy controls, suggesting a potential association with disease initiation. Mechanistically, we detail how microbial dysbiosis, including that of bacteria, fungi, and viruses, disrupts intestinal barrier integrity, skews T helper 17/T regulatory and T follicular helper/T follicular regulatory immune axes, induces molecular mimicry, and alters the profiles of microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids. Diagnostically, microbial taxa and metabolites serve as promising biomarkers. Machine learning models based on microbiota profiles have achieved area under the curve (AUC) values exceeding 0.88, with discriminatory taxa such as Ruminococcus gnavus and Fusicatenibacter. Therapeutically, we reviewed microbiota-targeted interventions, such as probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, diet, and herbal medicines, highlighting the emerging field of pharmacomicrobiomics.

The traditional Chinese medicine compound Roujishuncuiyin can effectively improve skeletal muscle insulin resistance, but its mechanism has not been clarified. OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of Roujishuncuiyin on skeletal muscle insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mice. METHODS: Forty db/db mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized into a model group, a low-dose Roujishuncuiyin group, a high-dose Roujishuncuiyin group, and a positive drug group, with 10 mice in each group. The latter three administration groups were given 157.5 mg/g and 630 mg/g Roujishuncuiyin and 200 mg/g metformin hydrochloride aqueous solution by gavage once a day, respectively. In addition, 10 db/dm mice were selected as the blank control group. Mice in the model and blank control groups were given the same dose of 0.9% NaCl solution by gavage. After 12 weeks of intervention, fasting blood glucose was measured in each group of mice, and oral glucose tolerance test was performed to calculate the area under the blood glucose curve. ELISA was used to detect serum insulin level and calculate the resistance index. Mitochondrial structure of skeletal muscle tissue was observed under transmission electron microscopy. Western blot was used to detect the expression levels and phosphorylation levels of protein kinase B (AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) proteins in skeletal muscle. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Compared with the blank control group, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin and insulin resistance index were significantly higher in the model group (P < 0.05), the area under the curve of the oral glucose tolerance test was significantly increased (P < 0.05), the expression of p-AKT and p-GSK3β proteins in tibialis anterior muscle was significantly decreased (P < 0.05), and there was a large amount of mitochondrial damage in tibialis anterior muscle and a large number of lipid droplets in the interstitium. (2) Compared with the model group, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, and insulin resistance index were significantly reduced in the low-and high-dose Roujishuncuiyin groups and the positive control group (P < 0.05), the area under the curve of the oral glucose tolerance test was reduced (P < 0.05), the expression of p-AKT and p-GSK3β proteins in the tibialis anterior muscle was significantly elevated (P < 0.05), and mitochondrial damage in the tibialis anterior muscle was significantly ameliorated, with decreased lipid droplets in the interstitium. (3) The above indexes were better in the high-dose Roujishuncuiyin group than the low-dose Roujishuncuiyin group (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference between the high-dose Roujishuncuiyin group and positive control group (P > 0.05). To conclude, by upregulating the protein levels of p-AKT and p-GSK3β in skeletal muscle tissue, the traditional Chinese medicine compound Roujishuncuiyin can improve structural disorders and mitochondrial morphology in skeletal muscle tissue, reduce insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle and regulate glucose homeostasis in the body. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006829051

It is effective for tendon injury, fracture, bone nonunion, bone fever, tingling, sore and other diseases. Our previous studies have confirmed that Mongolian medicine Echinops sphaerocephalus L. can promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, but its effect on angiogenesis in the process of bone defect repair is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Echinops sphaerocephalus L. on in vitro angiogenesis in human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells and to explore the angiogenesis-promoting active ingredients and their mechanisms of action of Echinops sphaerocephalus L. using network pharmacology technology. METHODS: The ethanol extract of Echinops sphaerocephalus L. was prepared and preserved by freeze-drying. The proliferation, migration, chemotaxis and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were observed after treatment with different concentrations (1 000, 100, and 10 μg/mL) of Echinops sphaerocephalus L. The active components and possible signaling pathways that promoted angiogenesis were enriched and analyzed by network pharmacology. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) The effect of Echinops sphaerocephalus L. on angiogenesis was regulated by its mass concentration: at low mass concentration (10 μg/mL), Echinops sphaerocephalus L. could promote the proliferation, migration, chemotaxis and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells; on the contrary, Echinops sphaerocephalus L. inhibited the proliferation, migration, and chemotaxis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells at high mass concentration (1 000 μg/mL). However, the inhibitory effect of Echinops sphaerocephalus L. on angiogenesis was not significant at high mass concentration due to the limitation of experimental time. 10 μg/mL Echinops sphaerocephalus L. could up-regulate the mRNA expression of angiogenesis-associated factors, including kinase insert domain receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor A, and hypoxia-inducible factor α, and thereby influenced angiogenesis during bone repair. (2) Network pharmacological analyses indicated that Echinops sphaerocephalus L. may bind to eight core targets (TGFB1, TNF, IL-6, STAT3, CTNNB1, IL-1B, AKT1, and HIF-1A) through four core active components (apigenin, caffeic acid, quercetin, and chlorogenic acid) to exert an effect on angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, multiple viral infections, and tumor angiogenesis-related signaling pathways. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006804440

In addition, the expression and activity of SOX5 and its family are regulated by a variety of diseases and different forms of exercise, among other factors, suggesting that SOX5 and its family have the potential to be effective as drugs and therapeutics to ameliorate related diseases in the future. OBJECTIVE: To provide new perspectives for future research on SOX5 and to provide scientific basis for the application of exercise intervention and drug therapy in the prevention and treatment of bone diseases. METHODS: CNKI and PubMed databases were searched for relevant literature published from 2001 to June 2024, and the search terms were “SRY-related HMG-box5, SOX5, Bone” in Chinese and English, respectively. After screening, analysis and summarization, 105 articles were included in the final review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Role of SOX5 in bone development: SOX5 is an important member of the SOX family, which plays a central role in the regulation of skeletal development, bone metabolism and cartilage formation. In synergy with SOX6 and SOX9, SOX5 activates gene expression in osteoblasts and chondrocytes by binding to specific DNA sequences to regulate bone formation and bone remodeling. (2) Abnormal expression of SOX5 is closely related to bone and joint diseases such as chondrodysplasia, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, suggesting that it may be a key regulator of these diseases. Currently, a variety of drugs may be used to treat bone metabolism-related diseases by regulating SOX5 and its family, and upregulation of SOX5 in mesenchymal stem cells may be effective in improving the symptoms of bone metabolism disease patients in bone tissue engineering. (3) Exercise may effectively prevent osteoporosis and related bone diseases by enhancing bone metabolism and promoting osteoblast differentiation and bone density increase. This mechanism of action may be related to the specific regulatory mechanism of SOX5, especially in different types, intensities and durations of exercise need to be further explored and studied. In conclusion, SOX5 has an important regulatory role in bone development, chondrogenesis, and prevention of bone diseases, and its activity is regulated by a variety of factors, while exercise intervention provides a new scientific basis for the treatment of bone diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105006741925

These systems can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs through non-covalent interactions and manipulation of lipid phase behavior. This review examines the molecular and supramolecular principles underlying the formation, stability, and functional performance of key phospholipid-based nanocarriers—including liposomes, transferosomes, ethosomes, invasomes, phytosomes, pharmacosomes, and virosomes. We analyze critical structural parameters such as bilayer packing, surface charge, curvature elasticity, and membrane permeability, emphasizing their impact on drug loading efficiency, controlled release, and bioavailability. Advanced multilamellar systems such as vesosomes and spongosomes are also highlighted for their promise in achieving site-specific, sustained drug delivery. Key fabrication methods—including thin-film hydration, ethanol injection, freeze–thaw cycles, and microfluidics—are discussed alongside analytical techniques such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). The review further explores the translational landscape, with a focus on clinically approved liposomal formulations, patent developments, and emerging clinical trials involving stimuli-responsive systems. Persistent challenges such as colloidal stability, tumor penetration, immune system interactions, and scalable manufacturing are critically assessed.

Their type or quantity allows for a better understanding of brain function, diagnosis of neurological diseases, monitoring the effects of neuroactive substances, assessing treatment effectiveness, or conducting scientific research. For these reasons, it is essential to use analytical methods suitable to detect neurotransmitters at low levels, most often in biological samples with a complex matrix (e.g., tissue homogenates, cerebrospinal fluid). This review article focuses on the use of high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection for the detection and determination of neurotransmitters as an alternative technique to mass spectrometry, capillary electrophoresis, electrochemical methods, or biosensors. The achievements made in the 21st century are presented with particular emphasis on the point of view of analytical chemistry (highly sensitive, precise, versatile applications, low‑cost/economy, multi-analyte). The article presents and discusses the description of chromatographic methods, analytical procedure validation, and the most important validation parameters, categorized into three groups: monoamines and their metabolites, amino acids, and acetylcholine with choline. Additionally, the scope and purpose of the research conducted in the area of neurotransmitter determination, the description of the tested biological samples, the method of their preparation, and the extraction procedure are presented. A novelty is the use of a generalized evaluation of chromatographic methods using tools such as RGB Additive Color Model for Analytical Method Evaluation, and Blue applicability grade index for the evaluation of method practicality.

Few population-based studies have investigated the distinct and overlapping clinical correlates of suicidality in adolescents with bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Understanding these correlates may inform targeted prevention and intervention strategies. This study aims to examine the clinical correlates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) in a nationally representative sample of adolescents with and without mood disorders. Methods: Data from the National Comorbidity Survey – Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A; 2001–2004) was examined to compare the prevalence and clinical correlates of suicidal ideation/plan and suicide attempts between adolescents with BD, MDD, and those without mood disorders. Participants, ages 13–18 years, were interviewed using a modified version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview to confirm diagnoses for BD (n = 295), MDD (n = 1112) or controls without mood disorders (n = 8716). Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts in adolescents with BD (14.9 %) and MDD (17.2 %) was higher than in controls (1.4 %). Similarly, suicidal plans/ideation were more prevalent among adolescents with BD (20.4 %) and MDD (22.8 %) than controls (6.5 %). STBs were associated with longer duration of depressive episodes, antidepressant use, mental health treatment, and experiences of physical/sexual abuse in both MDD and BD groups. Conclusions: STBs are associated with multiple shared clinical correlates alongside diagnosis-specific correlates. These findings highlight the significance of depression burden and reward-related behaviors (smoking, SUD, eating disorders) as risk indicators, which could guide the development of targeted prevention and treatment strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011529213

Results showed that WM appears to be multifractal and significantly different from GM, but the variability of brain regions in WM was smaller than that in GM. For example, in WM, (‘Fornix’, ‘Inferior cerebellar peduncle L’, ‘Superior cerebellar peduncle R’, ‘Posterior corona radiata R’, and ‘Uncinate fasciculus L’) had higher multifractal scores than other regions; but in GM, the degree of multifractal in the parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and parietal lobe was higher than that of different regions.

This paper investigates the influence of chemical structures of wax-based additives on the rheological performance of crumb rubber modified bitumen (CRMB), with the goal of enhancing the understanding of how chemical activation of crumb rubber (CR) affects the performance of WRB at wide temperatures. The results show that CR improves the high-temperature rutting resistance and intermediate-temperature fatigue resistance of bitumen, while chemical activation has the opposite effect on rutting resistance and nearly has no effect on fatigue life. Wax-based additives with long carbon chains improve the high-temperature rutting resistance but deteriorate the fatigue life of inactivated and activated CRMB. The addition of inactivated and activated CR reduces the physical hardening degree of bitumen, and CR after chemical activation has a more significant influence. Nevertheless, waxes are the main contributors to the physical hardening of CRMB. Moreover, the strain sweep test at 5 °C shows potential to characterize low-temperature cracking resistance, and the increased internal stresses in CRMB and WRB caused by isothermal hardening can elevate the cracking risks of asphalt pavement at low temperatures. Overall, this investigation provides valuable insights into the mechanism of the effect of wax structures and grafting-activated recycled rubber on the performance of WRB, which offer guidance for the development of environmentally friendly WRB materials. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105008571664

OBJECTIVE: To review the research status of antioxidants in the treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration. METHODS: The first author searched the articles included in CNKI and PubMed databases. The literature search time was from inception to June 2024. Chinese search terms were “intervertebral disc degeneration, antioxidants, oxidative stress, signaling pathways.” English search terms were “antioxidants, oxidative stresses, oxidative DNA damage, intervertebral disc degenerations, degenerative disc disease*, disc degeneration*, signal pathway.” Finally, 92 articles that met the criteria were selected for review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Antioxidants have multiple roles in the treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration, including reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting inflammatory responses, promoting autophagy, inhibiting apoptosis, and protecting the extracellular matrix. Through the combined effect of multiple pathways, antioxidants are expected to become an important means in the treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration. (2) The nano-hydrogel system can quickly and stably target the delivery of antioxidants to the inside of the intervertebral disc and improve the bioavailability of antioxidants. Therefore, the development of new antioxidants and antioxidant combination treatment strategies carried by nano-hydrogel systems will be the focus of future research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000671098

Prussian blue nanoparticles have peroxidase-like activity, which can effectively remove reactive oxygen species in the pathological microenvironment and protect nucleus pulposus cells from oxidative stress damage. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the biological functions and mechanisms of Prussian blue nanoparticles in delaying nucleus pulposus degeneration in rats. METHODS: Prussian blue nanoparticles were prepared by hydrothermal method, and their micromorphology and particle size were characterized. Prussian blue nanoparticles with different mass concentrations (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 µg/mL) were used to intervene in the caudal nucleus pulposus cells of passage 2 SD rats. Cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 assay after 24 hours. 60 µg/mL Prussian blue nanoparticles were used to intervene in the caudal nucleus pulposus cells of passage 2 SD rats. The viability of nucleus pulposus cells was observed by live-dead staining after 1 and 3 days. Passage 2 SD rat caudal vertebrae nucleus pulposus cells were obtained and observed for cell adhesion before being divided into three intervention groups. The control group did not receive any intervention. The lipopolysaccharide group was added with lipopolysaccharide. The lipopolysaccharide + Prussian blue nanoparticle group was added with lipopolysaccharide and 60 µg/mL Prussian blue nanoparticles. Reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial superoxide, and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected 24 hours after intervention. RT-qPCR detection and Alcian blue staining were performed 48 hours after intervention. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Under transmission electron microscopy, Prussian blue nanoparticles were uniform nanocubes with an average particle size of 130 nm. (2) CCK-8 assay results showed that 20-60 µg/mL Prussian blue nanoparticles had no obvious cytotoxicity, and 60 µg/mL Prussian blue nanoparticles were selected for cell intervention in subsequent experiments. Live-dead staining results showed that 60 µg/mL Prussian blue nanoparticles had no effect on the viability of nucleus pulposus cells. (3) Compared with the control group, the levels of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide in nucleus pulposus cells in the lipopolysaccharide group were increased (P < 0.01), the mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased (P < 0.01), the mRNA expressions of type II collagen and aggrecan were decreased (P < 0.01), the mRNA expressions of matrix metalloproteinase 13 and thrombospondin integrin metallopeptidase 5 were increased (P < 0.01), and the positive area of Alcian blue staining was reduced (P < 0.01). Compared with the lipopolysaccharide group, the levels of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide in nucleus pulposus cells in the lipopolysaccharide + Prussian blue nanoparticle group were decreased (P < 0.01), mitochondrial membrane potential increased (P < 0.01), mRNA expression of type II collagen and aggrecan increased (P < 0.01), mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase 13 and thrombospondin integrin metallopeptidase 5 decreased (P < 0.01), and positive area of Alcian blue staining increased (P < 0.01).

With the maturity of decellularization technology, decellularized extracellular matrix is receiving increasing attention in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Due to its high activity, low immunogenicity, and ability to support cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation, decellularized tendon scaffolds are expected to promote tendon repair. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the biological characteristics of decellularized tendon scaffolds, elucidate the mechanism by which decellularized tendon scaffolds promote tendon healing, and explain the application methods and future limitations of decellularized tendon scaffolds in combination with other materials. METHODS: Relevant literature was retrieved from China National Knowledge Infrastructure and PubMed databases using the Chinese search terms “tendon injury, tendon repair, tendon disease, decellularized tendon scaffold” and English search terms “tendon injury, tendon repair, tendinopathy, decellularized tendon scaffold, decellularized tendon scaffolds.” By reading and screening relevant literature, 77 articles were ultimately included for result analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Decellularization technology can be divided into physical treatment, chemical treatment, and biological procedures. (2) Decellularized tendon scaffolds, as a common biomedical material, have certain biocompatibility, biodegradability, and biomechanical properties, which provide a prerequisite and foundation for tendon injury repair. (3) Decellularized tendon scaffolds can alleviate the inflammatory response of tissues, promote the adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells/tendon derived stem cells, and maintain the biomechanical properties of tissues. (4) Decellularized tendon scaffolds can be used in combination with other materials, such as electrospinning, hydrogel, stem cell implantation, and 3D printing technology.

Conventional metallic devices are hindered by the need for revision surgeries, stress-shielding effects, and long-term biocompatibility issues. Magnesium alloys with favorable mechanical compatibility and biodegradability have therefore emerged as promising alternatives, yet their biological activity and antibacterial efficacy remain insufficient. In this study, mussel-inspired protein coatings of varying concentrations were constructed on ZK60 magnesium alloy to systematically evaluate their biological performance. Results demonstrated that the coatings adhered robustly to the substrate and significantly increased surface hydrophilicity. Among them, the 0.5 mg mL⁻¹ coating exhibited markedly superior cell viability, alkaline phosphatase activity, osteogenesis-related gene expression, anti-inflammatory behavior, and hemocompatibility compared to the uncoated control. This coating achieved antibacterial rates of 83.72 %, 91.12 %, and 92.06 % against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans, respectively, while reducing the hemolysis rate to 1.43 %. The findings provide experimental evidence and technical guidance for the clinical translation of magnesium-based orthopedic implants, accelerating their application in bone defect repair. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013843116

Graphene oxide (GO) was chemically modified with 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine (TAP) to improve its dispersibility and interfacial reactivity. Subsequently, polyaniline (PANI) was uniformly grafted onto the TAP-functionalized GO (TAPGO) via in-situ oxidative polymerization, forming a TAPGO-PANI nanostructure. Comprehensive characterizations, including FTIR, XRD, XPS, TEM, and SEM, confirmed the successful formation of TAPGO-PANI. The as-prepared TAPGO-PANI was incorporated into a WEP matrix, and the anticorrosion performance was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potentiodynamic polarization, and salt spray tests. Among the tested formulations, the coating containing 2 wt% 0.10TAPGO-PANI filler applied on Q235 carbon steel exhibited the highest corrosion resistance, retaining a low-frequency impedance modulus (|Z|<inf>f=0.01 Hz</inf>) of 1.69 × 109 Ω·cm² after 30 days of immersion in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. The enhanced performance was attributed to a tri-functional protection mechanism integrating molecular-scale barrier layers (GO), chemical inhibition (TAP), and electrochemical passivation (PANI).

The therapeutic potential of exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) is not fully understood, especially regarding whether hypoxic preconditioning enhances their efficacy in POI. In this study, exosomes were isolated and identified from hucMSCs (hucMSCs-Exos) under hypoxic (HExos) and normoxic (NExos) conditions. Cyclophosphamide (CTX) was used to develop the POI rat model, and NExos or HExos was injected into the tail vein to investigate its therapeutic effect on POI. In addition, CTX-treated KGN cell lines were used to investigate the effects of NExos and HExos on cell proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress and mitochondrial membrane potential.The results indicated that hucMSCs-Exos transplantation substantially improved body weight, ovarian weight coefficient, estrous cycles, ovarian morphology, ovulation count, and sex hormone levels in POI rats. Further, HExos showed a higher level of therapeutic efficiency than NExos. In vitro experiments demonstrated that NExos and HExos may be phagocytosed by KGN cell line, decrease cell apoptosis, and enhance cell growth. After NExos or HExos transplantation, the reactive oxygen species level was reduced, mitochondrial membrane potential enhanced, and the levels of mitochondrial oxidative stress-associated factors returned to their basal level. Notably, the improvement of oxidative stress by NExos or HExos was blocked by the SIRT3 selective inhibitor 3-TYP. In conclusion, hypoxia-induced hucMSCs-Exos protected the ovarian reserve against CXT-induced ovarian damage by rectifying mitochondrial malfunction via the SIRT3/PGC1-α pathway, establishing a solid basis for developing specific ovarian protection therapies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000799185

This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of CWQ in CRC treatment through bioinformatics analysis and network pharmacology. Methods: Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform and SwissTargetPrediction database were used to collect the bioactive components of CWQ. The databases including DisgeNET, GeneCards, MalaCards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man and Comparative Toxicogenomics were used to obtain CRC-related targets. The Cancer Genome Atlas - colon adenocarcinoma dataset was used to obtain prognosis-related genes in CRC based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). A protein-protein interaction network was constructed to screen core targets, with STRING database and Cytoscape software. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery database. Molecular docking was performed with AutoDock Vina software. Core targets were further analyzed using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis platform, Human Protein Atlas database, University of ALabama at Birmingham CANcer data analysis Portal (UALCAN) and GeneMANIA database. In vitro experiments were further performed to investigate the effects of quercetin, one of the main components of CWQ, on CRC cells. Results: 6356, 1901 and 2980 CRC-related genes were obtained from differential expression analysis, WGCNA and open access databases, respectively. CWQ contained a total of 70 bioactive ingredients, of which 64 ingredients had a total of 836 therapeutic targets. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that CWQ may be involved in regulating pathways in cancer, MAPK signaling pathway and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, and further analysis identified 14 core targets of CWQ. These core targets were significantly correlated with cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway and pathways in cancer. Among these core targets, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 A (CDKN2A) expression was closely associated with shorter overall survival and clinical stage of CRC patients. The main bioactive ingredients of CWQ targeting CDKN2A were quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, 7-O-methylisomucronulatol and 7-Methoxy-2-methyl isoflavone. Additionally, quercetin caused G0/G1 phase arrest and inhibited the viability of CRC cells.

This study investigates the therapeutic potential of Luetzelburgia auriculata lectin (LAA), a plant-derived protein, in accelerating wound closure. Excisional wounds were created on the backs of mice, which were subsequently treated topically with LAA solutions at two concentrations (100 µg/mL and 200 µg/mL) or saline control. Wound healing was assessed through clinical observations, including wound area measurement and inflammatory score, as well as histopathological analysis and measurement of inflammatory cytokines. LAA significantly accelerated wound closure, reduced inflammation, and promoted tissue regeneration. Histological analysis revealed enhanced re-epithelialization, increased fibroblast proliferation, and improved collagen deposition in LAA-treated wounds compared with the control group. Furthermore, LAA treatment significantly reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in wound tissues (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1). These findings suggest that LAA exerts its beneficial effects through a multifaceted mechanism, likely involving anti-inflammatory properties and stimulation of cellular processes crucial for tissue repair. This study provides preliminary evidence for the therapeutic potential of LAA in wound healing and warrants further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and clinical applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000773520

However, the current symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies have achieved limited benefits for neurodegenerative diseases in clinical settings. Halting the progress of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline or even improving impaired cognition and function are the clinically meaningful goals of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Ageing is the primary risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases and their associated comorbidities, such as vascular pathologies, in elderly individuals. Thus, we aim to elucidate the role of ageing in neurodegenerative diseases from the perspective of a complex system, in which the brain is the core and peripheral organs and tissues form a holistic network to support brain functions. During ageing, the progressive deterioration of the structure and function of the entire body hampers its active and adaptive responses to various stimuli, thereby rendering individuals more vulnerable to neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, we propose that the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases should be grounded in holistic antiageing and rejuvenation means complemented by interventions targeting disease-specific pathogenic events. This integrated approach is a promising strategy to effectively prevent, pause or slow down the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000768359

Brown and beige adipose tissues are known for their remarkable catabolic capacity, and their ability to diminish blood glucose plasma concentration. Beige adipose tissue can be differentiated from adipose-derived stem cells or through transdifferentiation from white adipocytes. However, the impact of T2D progression on beige adipocytes’ functional capacity remains unclear. Transcriptomic profiling of subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies from healthy normal-weight, obese, prediabetic obese, and obese subjects diagnosed with T2D, reveals a progressive alteration in cellular processes associated with catabolic metabolism, circadian rhythms, thermogenesis-related signaling pathways, cellular stress, and inflammation. MAX is a potential transcription factor that links inflammation with the circadian clock and thermogenesis during the progression of T2D. This study unveils an unrecognized transcriptional circuit that increasingly disrupts subcutaneous adipose tissue oxidative capacity during the progression of T2D. These findings could open new research venues for developing chrono-pharmaceutical strategies to treat and prevent T2D.

Interleukin27 (IL-27) gene is a cytokine that produces antiviral proteins in an IFN-independent manner and stimulates both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. Interferon induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) inhibits SARS-CoV2 infection by blocking SARSCoV-2 spike proteins which facilitate viral entrance and cell-to-cell fusion. The association between genetic variants and COVID-19 in Egyptians is still unclear. Hence, we sought to investigate the impact of the single nucleotide polymorphism of IL-27P28 rs153109 and IFITM3 rs12252 on the susceptibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 in Egyptian patients. Methods: Our study included 242 SARS-CoV-2 patients were recruited from Main University Hospital, Alexandria University, Egypt, and 187 healthy controls. We subdivided the patient group into two subgroups: group A comprised mild/moderate cases (N = 42) (17.4%), and group B included severe/critical cases (N = 200) (82.6%). Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit, then the PCR products of IL27 and IFITM3 were cut by FastDigest XhoI and MScI, respectively, for detection of SNPs of IL-27P28 rs153109 (-964A/G) and IFITM3 rs12252 (T>C). Results: The present study found a significant association between IL27 rs153109 (-964A/G) and SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility after adjusting for the risk factor (advanced age), IL27 rs153109 (-964A/G) AG genotype (OR = 2.791, 95% CI: 1.237–6.295, P = 0.013), AA genotype (OR = 2.385, 95% CI: 1.075–5.291, P = 0.033), and (AG+AA vs. GG) genotypes (OR = 2.558, 95% CI: 1.186–5.517, P = 0.017). On the other hand, the IFITM3 rs12252(T>C) CT genotype (OR = 1.419, 95% CI: 0.843–2.391, P = 0.188), CC genotype (OR = 2.132, 95% CI: 0.436–10.415, P = 0.350), and (C/T+C/C vs. TT) genotypes (OR = 1.466, 95% CI: 0.884–2.432, P = 0.138) did not show a statistically significant association with either susceptibility or the severity of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: IL27P28 rs153109 AG and AA genotypes of IL27 may be associated with the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection but not the severity. Concerning the IFITM3 rs12252 SNP, we could not confirm its influence on either susceptibility or the severity of SARS-CoV-2 in this Egyptian population. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000759484

Loss of social dominance can lead to brain disorders such as depression, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The gut microbiota can sense stress and contribute to brain disorders via the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). Here, using a forced loss paradigm to demote dominant mice to subordinate ranks, we find that stress alters the composition and function of the gut microbiota, increasing Muribaculaceae abundance and enhancing butanoate metabolism, and gut microbial depletion resists forced loss-induced hierarchical demotion and behavioral alteration. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) indicates that social status loss primarily affected interneurons, altering GABAergic synaptic transmission. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) reveals modules linked to forced loss in the gut microbiota, colon, PFC, and PFC interneurons, suggesting changes in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and the glutamatergic synapse. Our findings provide evidence for MGBA perturbations induced by social status loss, offering potential intervention targets for related brain disorders. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000758834

Its pathogenesis is closely associated with the intestinal flora. This study aimed to explore the enterotypes in AD by identifying key bacteria through machine learning and species co-occurrence network analysis. Methods: The collection of fecal samples from AD patients was followed by 16 S rRNA analysis using QIIME2. Enterotype clustering was conducted at the genus level, and deep neural network (DNN) classification models were developed for AD and healthy controls within each enterotype. Results: Analysis of three 16 S rRNA gut microbiome datasets identified three distinct enterotypes: Escherichia_Shigella (ET-E), Faecalibacterium (ET-F), and Bacteroides (ET-B). The ET-E is mainly characterized by the absence of Akkermansia in AD group. The Akkermansia was significantly positively correlated with Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group and negatively correlated with biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism. The ET-F highly expressed Agathobacter, un_f__Lachnospiraceae, Lachnoclostridium, and low expressed Dorea in AD group. Among them, Agathobacter was significantly positively correlated with un_f__Lachnospiraceae, and un_f__Lachnospiraceae was significantly positively correlated with Lachnoclostridium. The Dorea was significantly negatively correlated with Lachnoclostridium. The AD from ET-B group had high expression of two beneficial bacteria, Butyricicoccus and Parabacteroides. The findings suggest that the ET-E enterotype may predispose individuals to AD, with Akkermansia identified as a potential risk factor. Conversely, the ET-B enterotype appears to be associated with milder symptoms, with Butyricicoccus and Parabacteroides potentially serving as protective factors. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the species characteristics and interactions within different enterotypes is essential for modulating the gut-brain axis and mitigating AD symptoms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000757918

It is a prevalent infectious disease among outpatients and hospitalized patients, leading to morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic resistance among uropathogens varies geographically, but empirical treatment is common in our study area. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate antimicrobial susceptibility and risk factors of uropathogens in symptomatic UTI cases at Dessie Referral Hospital in northeast Ethiopia. Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study design was utilized to examine 256 participants with urinary tract complaints from February 1, 2024, to May 30, 2024. Consecutive convenience sampling was used to select participants. Midstream urine samples were collected, and bacteriological tests, including culture, Gram stain, biochemical tests, and antimicrobial susceptibility tests, were conducted following standard procedures. The data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20 software. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were carried out to identify potential risk factors associated with urinary tract infection. Results: The overall prevalence of bacteriuria was 22.7%. Escherichia coli (E. coli) accounted for the highest proportion 21(30.4%), followed by Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) at 15(21.7%) and Klebsiella spp 12(17.4%). Most Gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to gentamicin 19(90.5%) but less sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 16(76.2%) and nitrofurantoin 18(85.7%). High resistance rates were observed for penicillin 9(60%) and cefoxitin 14(66.7%). On the other hand, amikacin (83.3%), gentamicin (81.3%), and nitrofurantoin (89.7%) were effective against Gram-negative bacteria. Resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin was reported at 53.8% against both groups of bacteria. Female sex (AOR = 4.21; 95% CI = 1.43–8.29, P = 0.002), diabetes mellitus (AOR = 14.786; 95% CI = 3.91–70.72, P = 0.001), and human immunodeficiency virus positivity (AOR = 5.273; 95% CI = 2.596–17.410, P = 0.002) were identified as significant risk factors for bacteriuria. Conclusion: The prevalence of UTI among syptomatic patients was 22.7%. E. coli and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were the predominant isolates. The identified bacteria were resistant to commonly use antimicrobials. Therefore, there should be continuous surveillance of UTI and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to minimize urinary tract infection and antibiotic resistance in our study setting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000752660

While several studies have investigated the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT), the clarity of its long-term outcomes for SSc patients is still lacking. Methods: Data on MSCT were extracted from the medical records of inpatients at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital between January 2013 and December 2022. Additionally, Baseline characteristics and survival outcomes were ascertained from medical records and telephone follow-up. Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to equalize the baseline characteristics of the patient groups, while survival analysis and multivariate Cox regression assessed the relationship between received MSCT and all-cause mortality and disease-specific survival rates in SSc patients. Results: Of the 333 hospitalized SSc patients, 113 patients underwent MSCT. The log-rank test revealed significantly higher survival rates in the MSCT group compared to the control group (10-year survival rate 89.4% vs. 73.4%, P = 0.002). In the PSM cohort, receiving MSCT significantly reduced mortality (10-year survival 88.0% vs. 79.9%, P = 0.032). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that MSCT was linked to a reduced mortality risk during the follow-up period (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19–0.75, P = 0.005). This finding was further confirmed in the matched cohort (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18–0.82, P = 0.014). Subgroup analyses revealed that treated with MSCT was correlated with reduced mortality in patients of various demographics, including younger age at diagnosis (≤ 47 years), female, diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) subtype, concurrent arthritis, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Conclusion: MSCT significantly enhances the survival rate of patients with SSc, with outcomes related to the age at diagnosis.

For thousands of years, traditional medical systems in several nations have included shilajit in one form or another as a rejuvenator and adaptogen. Numerous medicinal qualities have been attributed to it, several of which have been confirmed by contemporary scientific analysis. This in vitro study was established to investigate the effect of shilajit on human Periodontal ligament (hPDL) cell wound closure. Methods: The cell viability was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)—2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide tetrazolium reduction (MTT) test following a 24-hour exposure of shilajit. With the use of an inverted phase contrast microscope, morphological alterations were noted. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide dual labeling, to evaluate the apoptotic cell death in shilajit treated cells. An in vitro wound healing test was utilized to evaluate wound healing in wounded hPDL cell monolayers for 24 h in the presence or absence of shilajit. The Matrix metalloproteinases-2 and 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in hPDL cells treated with shilajit were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, and real-time PCR was used to examine gene expression linked to wound healing and apoptosis. Results: Shilajit’s cytotoxicity evaluation on hPDL cells showed that dosages as high as 3 mg/mL had no adverse effects and maintains the cell viability, suggesting a possible stimulatory effect on cell growth. Cell viability was reduced significantly (p < 0.05) by dosages more than 4 mg/mL, indicating cytotoxicity at higher concentrations. According to the scratch wound healing assay, shilajit administration at doses of 2 and 3 mg/mL accelerated wound healing and improved cell migration in hPDL cells. Shilajit promoted a controlled inflammatory response and supported periodontal ligament healing by upregulating the expression of genes involved in collagen synthesis, collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and, interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β), according to real-time PCR data. In addition, Shilajit raised the protein levels of MMP2 and MMP9, two important enzymes involved in tissue remodeling. Shilajit-treated hPDL cells showed a substantial increase of cell proliferation and no discernible apoptotic activity. Conclusions: Our research offers novel proof that shilajit promotes hPDL cell migration and proliferation, which in turn promotes wound closure. According to these results, Shilajit may improve tissue regeneration, accelerate wound healing, and encourage the growth of periodontal ligament cells. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000733356

This study investigates the protective mechanism of Rosa roxburghii Tratt. (RRT) extract against UVB-induced inflammaging. RRT extract effectively reduces the secretion of IL-6, IL-1α, TNF-α, and PGE2 in keratinocytes. Additionally, it attenuates UVB-induced IL-17 pathway activation by downregulating IL-17RA, c-Fos, and c-Jun protein levels, as well as the gene expression of IL-17RA, TRAF6, HSP90, and IKKγ. Co-culturing human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) with inflammatory factors secreted by UVB-exposed keratinocytes reveals that these factors significantly reduce mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby promoting aging in HFF. The anti-inflammaging effects of RRT extract are achieved through the reduction of β-galactosidase activity, targeting of the TGF-β1-Smad2/3 signaling pathway, upregulation of COL1A1 expression, and reduction of senescence-associated secretory phenotype secretion. This study provides a novel perspective and robust scientific foundation for exploring mechanisms of skin aging and potential therapeutic interventions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000730235

Sourced from various tissues like alveolar bone, calvarial bone, mandibular and maxillary bones, long bones, and bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs), each type of osteoblast presents unique advantages and limitations related to yield, accessibility, and clinical relevance. Given these variables, selecting an appropriate source is crucial for experimental consistency and translational application in dentistry. Methods: This review synthesizes data from in vitro, animal, and clinical studies to provide a comprehensive overview of osteoblast sourcing, isolation, and characterization in dental research. Sources were reviewed based on yield, anatomical relevance, and accessibility, while isolation methods were compared to assess their impact on cell behavior and phenotype retention. The review evaluates methods such as enzymatic digestion, explant culture, and differentiation of BMSCs, alongside characterization techniques like morphological analysis, gene expression profiling, and mineralization assays. Results: The analysis shows that alveolar bone-derived osteoblasts offer high clinical relevance due to their anatomical similarity to oral structures but are limited by low yield and invasive collection. Calvarial and long bone osteoblasts provide higher yields, making them useful for material testing, though they lack biomechanical compatibility with oral environments. BMSCs offer a renewable source with significant regenerative potential but require precise differentiation protocols. In vitro studies contribute mechanistic insights, while animal models bridge the gap to clinical application, despite challenges in standardization and interspecies variability. Conclusion: This review highlights the importance of selecting appropriate osteoblast sources and methods for dental research to optimize outcomes in periodontal and implant-related therapies. The variability across study designs and experimental outcomes underscores the need for standardized protocols and targeted systematic reviews within specific research settings. These findings offer a framework for future osteoblast-based research and guide the effective translation of osteoblast therapies into clinical dental practice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000726183

Melatonin (MT) has shown promise in treating PCOS by improving mitochondrial dysfunction, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we first assessed the levels of proteins associated with mitochondrial autophagy and dynamics in ovary granulosa cells (GCs) of PCOS patients and in the ovaries of DHEA-induced PCOS mice. We found abnormal expression of these proteins, indicating the presence of mitochondrial dysfunction in PCOS ovaries. Notably, the expression of the circadian gene Clock and melatonin synthetic enzymes were also decreased in the ovaries of PCOS patients. Studies have suggested a potential role of circadian rhythm genes in the pathogenesis and progression of PCOS. We subsequently observed that pretreatment with MT could ameliorate the abnormal levels of mitochondrial-related proteins, reverse the low expression of CLOCK, and reduce pyroptosis in PCOS ovaries. Given the potential interaction between MT and Clock, we focused on whether exogenous MT improves mitochondrial dysfunction in PCOS ovaries by regulating the expression of the circadian gene Clock. Through in vitro culture of the human ovarian granulosa cell line KGN, we further found that when CLOCK levels were inhibited, the beneficial effects of MT on abnormal mitochondrial autophagy, disturbed mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial dysfunction in PCOS ovaries were not significant, and there was no notable improvement in ovary GCs pyroptosis. Our study suggests that MT may improve ovary mitochondrial dysfunction by regulating circadian gene Clock while also reducing GCs pyroptosis in PCOS. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000356024

Neurological function, BBB permeability, immune cell infiltration, macrophage polarization, and glycolytic activity were assessed using immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, quantitative PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Esketamine treatment significantly reduced structural brain tissue damage, including contusions, tissue loss, and edema, while also improving neurological outcomes in TBI mice. Mechanistically, esketamine inhibited CD4 + T cell activation and suppressed Th17 differentiation both in vivo and in vitro. It also promoted a shift in macrophage polarization from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Further analysis revealed that esketamine blocked STAT3 activation, which in turn reduced the expression of glycolytic genes (e.g., Hk2, Pgk1, Aldoa) essential for Th17 cell proliferation and M1 polarization. Co-treatment with colivelin reversed esketamine’s effects on STAT3-mediated glycolysis, while 2-DG enhanced its anti-inflammatory actions. Conclusion: Esketamine attenuates TBI-induced neuroinflammation and tissue damage by inhibiting STAT3-mediated glycolysis, thus reducing Th17 and M1 macrophage activity and promoting regulatory and reparative immune responses. These findings highlight esketamine’s potential as a therapeutic option for TBI, targeting both immune modulation and metabolic pathways to alleviate secondary injury.

Central to this neurovascular interaction is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, a group of secreted growth factors traditionally known for their roles in promoting endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival in the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems. However, emerging evidence shows that VEGFs also play indispensable roles in the nervous system, extending beyond their canonical angiogenic and lymphangiogenic functions. Over the past two decades, VEGFs have been found to exert direct effects on neurons, influencing key aspects of neuronal function independently of their actions on vascular cells. In particular, it has become increasingly evident that VEGFs also play crucial functions in the development, regulation, and maintenance of neuronal morphology. Understanding the roles of VEGFs in neuronal development is of high scientific and clinical interest because of the significance of precise neuronal morphology for neural connectivity and network function, as well as the association of morphological abnormalities with neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. This review begins with an overview of the VEGF family members, their structural characteristics, receptors, and established roles in vasculature. However, it then highlights and focuses on the exciting variety of neuronal functions of VEGFs, especially their crucial role in the development, regulation, and maintenance of neuronal morphology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000347359

ALI is associated with permeability and glycolysis changes in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. Our study demonstrates that heparin-binding protein (HBP), released from neutrophils during sepsis, exacerbates endothelial permeability and glycolysis, thereby triggering ALI. Through coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, TRIM21 was identified as a HBP interaction partner. Notably, HBP enhances the protein stability of TRIM21 by inhibiting K48 ubiquitination. TRIM21 binds to and promotes K63-linked ubiquitination of P65, facilitating its nuclear translocation. TRIM21 regulates HPMEC permeability and glycolysis in a manner dependent on P65 nuclear translocation. HBP stabilizes TRIM21 and enhances TRIM21 interactions with P65. Rescue experiments conducted in vivo and in vitro demonstrate that modulation of endothelial permeability and glycolysis by HBP is predominantly mediated through the TRIM21-P65 axis. Our results suggest that targeting the HBP/TRIM21/P65 axis is a novel therapeutic strategy to ameliorate ALI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000346246

However, its association with RDs has not been assessed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting circulating periostin in RD patients and healthy controls. We searched electronic databases from inception to 30 November 2024 for relevant articles and assessed the risk of bias and the certainty of evidence using the JBI critical appraisal checklist and GRADE, respectively. In 12 eligible studies, there was a non-significant trend towards higher periostin concentrations in RD patients (standard mean difference, SMD = 0.46, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.98, p = 0.089; I2 = 94.2%, p < 0.001). The results were stable in sensitivity analysis. There were no significant associations between the SMD and age, male-to-female ratio, number of participants, or publication year. However, we observed significant periostin elevations in studies investigating systemic sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis but not osteoarthritis. Significant periostin reductions were observed in studies investigating ankylosing spondylitis and dermatomyositis. Furthermore, the SMD was significant in studies conducted in America, but not Asia or Europe. Our study suggests significant periostin elevations in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis. Such elevations may reflect a more pronounced dysregulation of angiogenesis and fibrosis when compared to other RDs.

Conversely, molecules generated by organs such as bone, the gut, and adipose tissue can also impact liver function. Accumulating evidence suggests bidirectional communication between the liver and other organs. However, research on how extracellular vesicles (EVs), which transport active molecular mediators, contribute to this interorgan communication is still in its nascent stages. EVs are capable of transporting functional molecules, including lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins, thereby affecting recipient cells across different organs at the biological level. This review examines the role of EVs in facilitating bidirectional communication between the liver and other organs such as bone, the cardiovascular system, the gut, the pancreas, the brain, the lungs, the kidneys, and adipose tissue. It explores their potential in disease treatment and highlights the challenges in understanding EV-mediated interorgan interactions. The contribution of mediator-carrying EVs to two-way communication between the liver and other organs remains an area of ongoing investigation.

Metformin hydrochloride (DMBG) remains the most widely prescribed medication for this condition. This study aimed to elucidate the effects and underlying mechanisms by which DMBG enhances glucolipid metabolism using both in vivo and in vitro experimental models. Animal models were established using high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, while cellular models utilized palmitic acid (PA)-induced HepG2 cells. In vivo, the impact of DMBG on glucolipid metabolism was evaluated through measurements of insulin and HbA1c levels, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (ipGTT), intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests (ipITT), as well as histological assessments with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Oil-red O staining. Mitochondrial function was assessed via biochemical assays of TBARS, SOD, ATP, and H2O2 levels in liver tissue, alongside determinations of mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS production, mtDNA content, and SIRT5 mRNA expression. For in vitro analysis, glucose consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS levels, and protein expressions of AMPK and PGC-1α were quantified in HepG2 cells. Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) techniques were employed to investigate the mechanistic pathways involved. Treatment with DMBG resulted in reduced levels of free fatty acids, body weight, and fat mass, while also alleviating hyperglycemia and hepatic lipid accumulation in HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, DMBG restored impaired mitochondrial function in these animals and increased SIRT5 expression via AMPK activation. In vitro, DMBG mitigated PA-induced alterations in glucose consumption and mitochondrial dysfunction in HepG2 cells, an effect that was abrogated upon SIRT5 knockdown. Overexpression of SIRT5 led to enhanced trifunctional enzyme subunit-alpha (ECHA) desuccinylation at the K540 site, thereby increasing its activity. Collectively, our findings indicate that DMBG improves hepatic glucolipid metabolism through a mechanism involving SIRT5-mediated ECHA desuccinylation, potentially offering a new therapeutic avenue for T2DM. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000341056

Sympathetic fibres innervate the BM and are components of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) niche [2]. Neuropathy of the HSPC niche is present and essential for disease development in experimental models of JAK2V617F+ myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and MLL-AF9+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and it is present in the BM of human MPN and AML patients [3, 4, 5–6]. Neuropathy contributes to mutant HSC expansion and represents an effective therapeutic target to block disease progression in JAK2V617F+ MPN mice [3]. The sympathomimetic agonist mirabegron restored nestin+ cells and reduced reticulin fibrosis in MPN patients [7]. Here, we show that neuropathy of the HSPC niche emerges in two additional experimental models of hematological disease including pre-leukemic myelopoiesis driven by NRASG12D and lymphoma/lymphoblastic leukemia driven by p53 deletion. Neuropathy involves severe ultrastructural damage in NRASG12D+ mice and AML patients as shown by electron microscopy. When further reinforced chemically, neuropathy has a profound impact on the experimental NRASG12D mouse model, promoting myeloid bias, reducing HSPC numbers and inducing changes in the stem cell microenvironment that include reduced numbers of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and increased presence of morphologically abnormal blood vessels in BM. Together, BM neuropathy is a prevalent factor in hematopoietic malignancies that involves important degradation of sympathetic fibres and contributes to disease in a different manner depending on the driver mutation. This should be taken in consideration in the clinic, given that chemotherapy induces neuropathy of the HSC niche [8] and it is the most frequent first line treatment for AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and MPN patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Letter,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000339211

These cells have a higher proliferative capability than adult MSCs and less immunogenic or tumorigenesis risk than fetal and embryonic stem cells. Additionally, they do not require invasive isolation methods like fetal and adult MSCs. We reviewed the main biological and therapeutic aspects of perinatal MSCs in a three-part article. In the first part, we revised the main biological features and characteristics of MSCs and the advantages of perinatal MSCs over other types of SCs. In the second part, we provided a detailed molecular background for the main biomarkers that can be used to identify MSCs. In the final part, we appraised the therapeutic application of perinatal MSCs in four major degenerative disorders: degenerative disc disease, retinal degenerative diseases, ischemic heart disease, and neurodegenerative diseases.

We recommend using at least two positive markers of stemness (CD29, CD73, CD90, or CD105) and two negative markers (CD34, CD45, or CD14) to exclude the hematopoietic origin. Moreover, utilizing perinatal MSCs for managing degenerative diseases presents a promising therapeutic approach.

The degradation of habitats resulting from agricultural development and deforestation poses a considerable risk to the accessibility of these vital plants. This research was conducted in the Fofa and Toba sub-districts of the Yem Zone in Central Ethiopia, aiming primarily to explore and record the medicinal plant species that indigenous communities use for treating various health issues in both people and livestock. Methods: This study was carried out between March 2023 and April 2024, involving a total of 96 informants, with 12 selected from each kebele. A range of quantitative methodologies were employed in the research, such as the informant consensus factor (ICF), fidelity level (FL), plant part value, preference ranking, and direct matrix ranking. Furthermore, various statistical analyses including independent t-tests, one-way ANOVA, correlation, and regression were performed using R to evaluate and compare the ethnobotanical knowledge among different groups of informants. Results: A total of 164 medicinal plant species from 140 genera and 60 families were identified in the study. Of these species, 67.68% were utilized for human ailments, 19.5% for livestock issues, and 12.8% for both. The sources of these medicinal plants included 81 species from wild areas, 35 from home gardens, 23 from agricultural fields, 15 from living fences, and 10 from roadsides. In terms of growth forms, herbs comprised the largest group with 76 species, followed by trees with 42 species, shrubs with 34 species, and climbers with 9 species. The most commonly used plant parts were leaves, followed by roots. Preparations were primarily made by crushing the plants, with other methods including powdering, chewing, smashing, and boiling. The highest informant consensus factor value of 91% indicated a significant healing potential for respiratory diseases, common colds, coughs, and fevers. Notably, A. sativum (for malaria) and H. rueppelii (for abdominal pain) recorded the highest fidelity level values. Additionally, the average number of medicinal plants reported by participants varied significantly across different demographic factors, including gender, age groups, educational levels, and experience (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The study area is home to a wide variety of potential medicinal plants along with valuable indigenous knowledge.

Under physiological conditions, oxidative free radicals generated by the mitochondrial oxidative respiratory chain, endoplasmic reticulum, and NADPH oxidases can be effectively neutralized by NRF2-mediated antioxidant responses. These responses elevate the synthesis of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, as well as key molecules like nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and glutathione (GSH), thereby maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Disruption of this finely tuned equilibrium is closely linked to the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases. Recent advances have broadened our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning this dysregulation, highlighting the pivotal roles of genomic instability, epigenetic modifications, protein degradation, and metabolic reprogramming. These findings provide a foundation for exploring redox regulation as a mechanistic basis for improving therapeutic strategies. While antioxidant-based therapies have shown early promise in conditions where oxidative stress plays a primary pathological role, their efficacy in diseases characterized by complex, multifactorial etiologies remains controversial. A deeper, context-specific understanding of redox signaling, particularly the roles of redox-sensitive proteins, is critical for designing targeted therapies aimed at re-establishing redox balance. Emerging small molecule inhibitors that target specific cysteine residues in redox-sensitive proteins have demonstrated promising preclinical outcomes, setting the stage for forthcoming clinical trials. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the intricate relationship between oxidative stress and disease pathogenesis and also discuss how these insights can be leveraged to optimize therapeutic strategies in clinical practice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000322509

This study reviews the intricate relationship between ferroptosis and the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway, highlighting its regulatory functions across multiple biological processes. Dysregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway is implicated in promoting or inhibiting ferroptosis, depending on the context. JAK2 promotes ferroptosis by activating STAT proteins, modulating the expression of key regulators like SLC7A11 and GPX4, and influencing iron homeostasis through pathways such as ferritinophagy and hepcidin regulation. STAT1 activation primarily enhances ferroptosis through the suppression of cystine-glutamate antiporter (System Xc−), leading to glutathione depletion and lipid peroxidation, contributing to cell death in conditions like Sjogren’s syndrome and age-related macular degeneration. In contrast, STAT3 plays a protective role by upregulating SLC7A11 and GPX4, which inhibits ferroptosis and promotes cell survival, particularly in cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. This study also discusses STAT6’s involvement in ferroptosis suppression in diseases like asthma and lung injury by regulating antioxidant defenses. Furthermore, the review explores potential therapeutic strategies targeting the JAK/STAT pathway to manipulate ferroptosis for disease treatment. In cancer therapy, modulating this pathway can enhance the effectiveness of ferroptosis inducers, offering promising avenues to overcome drug resistance. Additionally, the interplay between ferroptosis and JAK/STAT signaling in immune responses, oxidative stress, and lipid metabolism underscores its significance in disease progression and therapeutic intervention. By exploring these mechanisms, this study provides insights into the development of novel treatments targeting ferroptosis through JAK/STAT modulation, with implications for cancer, inflammatory diseases, and neurodegenerative conditions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000321042

This study aims to investigate whether ceramides act as cell-nonautonomous mediators of COPD development by transmitting metabolic stress from pulmonary macrophages to endothelial cells (ECs), compromising endothelial function and thereby orchestrating the pulmonary inflammation. Methods: We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from human lung tissues and bulk RNA sequencing data from alveolar macrophages (AMs) in COPD patients to investigate the transcriptomic profiles of ceramide biosynthesis enzymes. The expression changes of several key enzymes were validated in human lung sections, AMs isolated from CS-exposed mice, and cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-treated macrophages. Ceramide levels in macrophages and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) were quantified using mass spectroscopy lipidomics. EVs were further characterized by transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. The uptake of macrophage-derived EVs by ECs and their effects on endothelial barriers were evaluated in vitro using a co-culture system and in vivo using a CS-exposed COPD mouse model. Results: CS exposure upregulated enzymes involved in de novo ceramide biosynthesis in pulmonary macrophages, increasing levels of long- and very long-chain ceramides. These ceramides were packaged into EVs and delivered to ECs, where they disrupted gap junctions, increased endothelial permeability, and impaired EC migration. Silencing these enzymes involved in de novo ceramide biosynthesis in pulmonary macrophages could block this metabolic communication between macrophages and ECs mediated by EV-delivered ceramides, protecting EC function from CS exposure. When intratracheally administered to CS-exposed mice, these ceramide-rich macrophage-derived EVs exacerbated COPD by facilitating endothelial barrier disruption. Conclusion: Our study uncovered a novel mechanism in COPD pathogenesis, where pulmonary macrophages propagate CS-induced metabolic stress to ECs via ceramide-laden EVs, leading to endothelial barrier dysfunction.

This study intends to analyze the relationship between UHR and decline in renal function. Methods: Data were obtained from the 2011–2015 data of the China Health and Aging Tracking Survey (CHARLS) of Peking University, and 7,198 study participants were included and followed up until 2015. The eGFR (Total glomerular filtration rate) was estimated according to the CKD-EPI [1] creatinine equation. eGFR ≥ 60mL/min/1.73 m² at baseline renal function was defined as normal renal function, and eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73 m² at baseline renal function was defined as chronic kidney disease; new-onset eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73 m² was defined as the occurrence of decline in renal function; in the chronic kidney disease population decrease in eGFR ≥ 5mL/min/1.73 m²/year or 30% from baseline or admission to dialysis was defined as rapid progression of chronic kidney disease. eGFR slope was defined as the ratio of the difference between the final eGFR and the baseline eGFR over 4 years of follow-up. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between UHR and renal function decline or progression, as well as linear regression and non-linear regression to clarify the relationship between UHR and GFR slope in hypertensive patients, and the correlation between UHR and CRP, and to assess the relationship between UHR levels and the risk of renal function decline in hypertensive people. Results: (1) Hypertension was a risk factor for the decline of renal function (OR: 1.34, P = 0.03); (2) UHR was a risk factor for the decline of renal function in the hypertensive population (OR: 1.32, P = 0.02), and with the increasing level of UHR, the risk of developing CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) in hypertension was higher (P for trend = 0.03); (3) The subgroup analyses showed that there was no interaction between hypertension and age, cystatin C and hemoglobin did not interact with each other; (4), In the hypertensive population, the slope of UHR and eGFR showed a J-shaped correlation, with UHR > 7.6% as the cut-off point, and the slope of eGFR tended to increase with increasing UHR; in the non-hypertensive population UHR and eGFR showed a linear correlation, and the slope of the decline in eGFR was smaller than that of the hypertensive population; (5), After adjusting for confounders, UHR and CRP were positive correlation (t = 3.56, P < 0.05); (6) In the hypertensive population with normal CRP, the risk of decline in renal function increased accordingly with increasing UHR (P = 0.003). UHR did not show a correlation with CRP in the hypertensive population with abnormal CRP (P = 0.24). Conclusion: In the hypertensive population, elevated UHR is associated with an increased risk of decline in renal function; with UHR > 7.6% as the cut-off point, the slope of eGFR tended to increase with increasing UHR, and UHR can be used as an indicator for risk stratification of renal injury in the hypertensive population. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000315266

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) affects systemic lipid balance, potentially linking SCH to obesity. While the direct impact of TSH on hepatic lipid metabolism has been extensively documented, its role in modulating lipid dynamics in peripheral organs through liver-mediated pathways remains insufficiently understood. This study identifies TSH-stimulated hepatocyte-derived exosomes (exosomesTSH) as key mediators in liver-adipose communication, promoting triglyceride accumulation in adipocytes via the transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1)/adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) axis. ExosomesTSH enhance lipid storage in adipocytes, significantly increasing triglyceride content and lipid droplet formation while reducing lipolysis, effects that are dependent on TSH receptor (TSHR) activation in hepatocytes. In vivo, exosomesTSH induce weight gain and adipose tissue expansion, impairing glucose metabolism in both chow- and high-fat diet-fed mice. Mechanistically, exosomesTSH upregulate TGF-β1 and downregulate ATGL in adipocytes, establishing the TGF-β1/ATGL pathway as essential for exosome-mediated lipid accumulation.

This study investigates the effects of cholesterol on hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) proliferation and hair regeneration, with a focus on the underlying molecular mechanisms. Subcutaneous cholesterol injections in C57BL/6 mice significantly enhanced hair regeneration by promoting HFSCs proliferation. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining revealed a greater number of hair follicles in the anagen phase in the cholesterol-treated group compared to controls. Immunofluorescence (IF) and BrdU labeling further confirmed that cholesterol significantly stimulated HFSCs proliferation. Mechanistically, cholesterol activated the PKA signaling pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) at the serine 40 residue, which subsequently stimulated the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). SNS activation enhanced HFSCs proliferation and increased the proportion of hair follicles in the anagen phase. Furthermore, sympathetic nerve ablation significantly attenuated the hair regeneration-promoting effects of cholesterol, highlighting the critical regulatory role of SNS in this process.

In addition, LncRNAs regulate different downstream pathways like NF-κB, and PI3K/AKT. In this study, we gathered the existing studies regarding the mechanisms of action of LncRNAs in the pathogenesis of different CNS diseases like neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic injuries through regulating neuroinflammation. We aim to elaborate on the regulatory roles of LncRNAs in neuroinflammation and bring a more profound understanding of the etiology of CNS diseases in terms of neuroinflammation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000303854

This study aimed to reveal the role and downstream regulatory signaling of an m6A demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) in high glucose-induced damage of retinal pigment epithelial cells. Methods and results: By stimulating ARPE-19 cells with different concentrations of glucose (0 mM-50 mM), we observed that FTO expression was significantly downregulated, while m6A modification level was upregulated in a glucose concentration-dependent manner in ARPE-19 cells. Then, ARPE-19 cells were transfected with FTO knockdown or overexpression vector, and administrated with high glucose (25mM) to perform functional verification experiments. FTO overexpression recovered cell viability, inhibited cell apoptosis, elevated GSH/GSSG ratio, but reduced MDA and ROS levels in high glucose-induced cells, while FTO knockdown further exacerbated high glucose-triggered oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death. Additionally, FTO overexpression upregulated the expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and activated the antioxidant heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) signal through m6A demethylation on Nrf2 in high glucose-treated ARPE-19 cells. Finally, we proved that knockdown of Nrf2 or HO-1 reversed the protective effects of FTO overexpression on high glucose-treated ARPE-19 cells. Conclusion: Altogether, the study demonstrated that FTO ameliorates high glucose-triggered oxidative stress and cell apoptosis through activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in an m6A-dependent manner. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000303834

They play crucial roles in immune defense, surveillance, and homeostasis. This review systematically discusses the types of hematopoietic progenitors that give rise to macrophages, including primitive hematopoietic progenitors, erythro-myeloid progenitors, and hematopoietic stem cells. These progenitors have distinct genetic backgrounds and developmental processes. Accordingly, macrophages exhibit complex and diverse functions in the body, including phagocytosis and clearance of cellular debris, antigen presentation, and immune response, regulation of inflammation and cytokine production, tissue remodeling and repair, and multi-level regulatory signaling pathways/crosstalk involved in homeostasis and physiology. Besides, tumor-associated macrophages are a key component of the TME, exhibiting both anti-tumor and pro-tumor properties. Furthermore, the functional status of macrophages is closely linked to the development of various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic conditions, and trauma. Targeting macrophages has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy in these contexts. Clinical trials of macrophage-based targeted drugs, macrophage-based immunotherapies, and nanoparticle-based therapy were comprehensively summarized. Potential challenges and future directions in targeting macrophages have also been discussed. Overall, our review highlights the significance of this versatile immune cell in human health and disease, which is expected to inform future research and clinical practice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000300912

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of oral mesenchymal stem cells (OMSCs) on inflammatory, oxidative stress, and histopathological indices in the tissues of the stomach, intestine, and colon after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods and materials: Adult male rats were randomly divided into four groups: Sham, TBI, Vehicle (Veh), and Stem cell (SC). Intravenous injection of OMSCs was performed at 1 and 24 h after injury. The inflammatory, oxidative stress, and histopathological indices of the tissues of the stomach, small intestine, and colon were evaluated 48 h after injury. Results: After TBI, IL-1β and IL-6 levels increased and IL-10 levels decreased in the tissues of the stomach, small intestine, and colon, but the administration of OMSCS prevented these changes to a large extent. Oxidative stress indices (MDA, PC, TAC, SOD, and CAT) showed an increase in oxidative stress after TBI, but oxidative stress was less severe in the OMSC group. The administration of OMSCs after TBI improved the histopathological outcome in the tissues of the stomach, small intestine, and colon. Conclusion: Administration of OMSCs in rats suffering from TBI can improve inflammatory, oxidative stress, and histopathological indices in the tissues of the stomach, small intestine, and colon, which shows the beneficial effect of using OMSCs in TBI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000300873

However, variability in quality and quantity between different tissue sources and donors presents a significant challenge to their use. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a promising and abundant alternative source of MSCs, offering a potential solution to the limitations of adult MSCs. Nevertheless, a standardized protocol for the differentiation of iPSCs into iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs) has yet to be established, as the existing methods vary significantly in terms of complexity, duration, and outcome. Many straightforward methods induce differentiation by culturing iPSCs in MSC media which are supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) or human platelet lysate (hPL), followed by selection of MSC-like cells by passaging. However, in our hands, this approach yielded inconsistent quality of iMSCs, particularly in terms of osteogenic potential and premature senescence. This study examines the impact of the selective TGF-β inhibitor SB431542 on iMSC differentiation, demonstrating that TGF-β inhibition enhances osteogenic potential and reduces premature senescence. Additionally, we present a reliable, xeno-free method for producing high-quality iMSCs that can be adapted for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliance, thus enhancing the potential for clinical applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000299607

RT-qPCR was utilized the quantify the levels of LINC00968, miR-17-5p, STAT3, and osteogenic differentiation markers. ROC curve was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic significance. Osteogenic differentiation medium (OM) induced hBMSCs. Flow cytometry was used to examine apoptosis. DLR and RIP assay were performed to validate target binding. Results: LINC00968 was notably decreased in the serum and bone tissue of patients with OP, whereas it was markedly elevated during osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. LINC00968 has 78.65% sensitivity and 71.95% specificity in identifying OP patients from controls. Silencing of LINC00968 sharply diminished ALP activity and osteogenic differentiation markers levels while promoting apoptosis in hBMSCs under OM induction.

However, its role in the occurrence and development of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is not fully understood. Methods: In the present study, an IVDD mouse model and Piezo1 small interfering (si)RNA was used to investigate the role of Piezo1 in IVDD progression. Furthermore, the Ca2+ inhibitor, BAPTA-AM, and the F-actin cytoskeleton polymerization inhibitor, Latrunculin A, were employed to examine the roles of Ca2+ influx and cytoskeleton dynamics in Piezo1-mediated IVDD progression. Additionally, Yes-associated protein (Yap) small interfering (si)RNA was used to investigate the involvement of Yap in Piezo1-induced IVDD progression. Results: The findings of the present study indicated that Piezo1 was positively associated with IVDD and that Piezo1 upregulation promoted IVDD via facilitating cartilage endplate (CEP) degeneration and calcification. The Ca2+ inhibitor, BAPTA-AM, and the F-actin cytoskeleton polymerization inhibitor, Latrunculin A, inhibited Piezo1-mediated extracellular matrix degradation and CEP chondrocyte degeneration. Moreover, it was found that Piezo1 activated Yap through an F-actin-mediated non-canonical pathway and that Yap siRNA inhibited Piezo1 upregulation-induced IVDD progression. Conclusion: Overall, the results of the present study indicate that increased expression of Piezo1 is closely related to the occurrence and development of IVDD and that the Piezo1-mediated Ca2+/F-actin/Yap axis contributes to this process.

Hyperspectral techniques have been applied to LCC research. However, quantitative prediction of grape LCC using this technique remains challenging due to baseline drift, spectral peak overlap, and ambiguity in the sensitive spectral range. To address these issues, two typical crop leaf hyperspectral data were collected to reveal the spectral response characteristics of grape LCC using standardization by variables (SNV) and multiple far scattering correction (MSC) preprocessing variations. The sensitive spectral range is determined by Pearson’s algorithm, and sensitive features are further extracted within that range using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Principal components analysis (PCA). Comparison of the prediction ability of Random Forest Regression (RFR) algorithm, Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR) model, and Genetic Algorithm-Based Neural Network (GA-BP) on grape LCC based on sensitive features. A SNV-RFE-GA-BP framework for predicting hyperspectral LCC in grapes is proposed, where =0.835 and NRMSE = 0.091. The analysis results show that SNV and MSC treatments improve the correlation between spectral reflectance and LCC, and different feature screening methods have a greater impact on the model prediction accuracy. It was shown that SNV-based processed hyperspectral data combined with GA-BP has great potential for efficient chlorophyll monitoring in grapevine.

In this study, the impact of AP in sepsis-induced acute liver injury (ALI) and the molecules involved were dissected. FKBP1A was predicted to be the sole target protein of AP that was also differentially expressed in the GSE166868 dataset. AP induced the protein expression of FKBP1A and suppressed that of NOTCH1 in a dose-dependent manner. AP ameliorated ALI in mice induced by D-galactosamine and LPS and inhibited LPS-induced liver parenchymal cell injury in vitro. By contrast, the protective effect of AP was significantly lost after the knockdown of FKBP1A. As a positive control, the therapeutic effect of dexamethasone on ALI may be related to NOTCH1, which was not related to FKBP1A. NOTCH1 promoted AK2 transcription in liver parenchymal cells, and FKBP1A inhibited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by impairing NOTCH1/AK2 signaling. Restoration of NOTCH1 significantly reversed the hepatoprotective effect of AP in ALI mice and LPS-induced liver parenchymal cell injury by activating the ER stress pathway. Therefore, AP-promoted FKBP1A expression inhibits ALI progression by blocking the NOTCH1/AK2-mediated ER pathway. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000280638

The results showed that LPS treatment led to down-regulation of NMNAT3 (decreased 58.72% at 1 µM), up-regulation of PARP1 (enhanced 22.78% at 1 µM), thereby impairing mitophagy and mitochondrial function. The negative effects can be mitigated through supplementation with NMN and PJ-34. Specifically, compared to the LPS group, the expression of NMNAT3 increased by 63.29% and PARP1 decreased by 27.94% at a concentration of 400 µM NMN. Additionally, when 400 µM NMN was combined with 5 µM PJ-34, PARP1 expression decreased by 21.99%. Mechanistic studies reveal that NMN and PJ-34 counteracted the detrimental effects by promoting the binding of FoxO1 to the PINK1 promoter to activate the PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy pathway. Further experimental results demonstrate that the down-regulation of NMNAT3 can activate PARP1 and inhibit the initiation of autophagic processes. Consequently, targeting the NMNAT3-PARP1 signaling pathway holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to alleviate mitochondrial damage-related disorders. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000280545

It is counterintuitive because lean mass is inversely correlated with obesity and metabolic diseases. Here, we use CRISPR to knock-in FTOrs9939609-A into hESC-derived tissue models, to elucidate potentially hidden roles of FTO during development. We find that among human tissues, FTOrs9939609-A most robustly affect human muscle progenitors’ proliferation, differentiation, senescence, thereby accelerating muscle developmental and metabolic aging. An edited FTOrs9939609-A allele over-stimulates insulin/IGF signaling via increased muscle-specific enhancer H3K27ac, FTO expression and m6A demethylation of H19 lncRNA and IGF2 mRNA, with excessive insulin/IGF signaling leading to insulin resistance upon replicative aging or exposure to high fat diet. This FTO-m6A-H19/IGF2 circuit may explain paradoxical GWAS findings linking FTOrs9939609-A to both leanness and obesity.

It is of positive significance to further explore risk stratification of COAD patients and identify predictive molecular biomarkers. PANoptosis is defined as a form of inflammatory cell death regulated by PANoptosome, with common features of pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis. The role of PANoptosis in COAD has not been fully studied. In this study, we analyzed significant differences in the expression of PANoptosis-related gene (PRG) features in COAD. Subsequently, the PANoptosis associated lncRNAs (PALs) associated with PRGs were analyzed by LASSO algorithm and multivariate Cox analysis, and PALs related to the prognosis of COAD were selected. Based on the expression patterns of prognostic PAL features, we performed unsupervised consensus cluster analysis to categorize COAD samples into distinct PAL molecular subtypes and investigate their associated immune infiltration characteristics. We subsequently constructed PAL score model based on prognostic characteristics and verified its independent prognostic value for COAD. The nomogram diagnostic model was established to confirm the prognostic value of PAL scoring system again. Pathway enrichment analysis, somatic mutation profiling, and drug sensitivity analysis were employed to comprehensively assess the clinical value of the PAL score. Additionally, qRT-PCR was used to further validate the abnormal expression of the selected targets in COAD.

This study aimed to identify potential risk factors for AVF, thereby offering theoretical insights for refining patient management strategies and surgical protocols. Methods: Clinical data of PVP patients treated between March 2018 and May 2020 were retrospectively analyzed, with an average follow-up period of 30 months. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence of recurrent symptomatic AVF. Demographic characteristics and imaging based parameters were assessed to identify potential risk factors for AVF. Results: Demographic parameters, including age, sex, body mass index, and fracture location (junctional or non-junctional), did not significantly differ between the two groups and were not found to be independent risk factors for AVF. However, patients with AVF exhibited significantly lower bone mineral density, as assessed by T-score and Hounsfield unit (HU) values. Notably, lower HU values emerged as an independent risk factor for AVF. Contrary to expectations, larger vertebral distraction and intervertebral disc cement leakage did not trigger higher incidence of AVF. Conclusion: Progression of bony density reduction emerged as the primary driver for the heightened incidence of AVF. Accordingly, anti-osteoporosis therapy should be regarded as an effective strategy for mitigating the risk of AVF in patients undergoing PVP. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000117200

To address this challenge, a novel therapeutic strategy was developed using cellulose supramolecular hydrogel as a carrier to deliver IL4I1-modified MΦ membrane biomimetic nanoparticles (CHG@IL4I1-MNPs) to target tissues. This hydrogel exhibits excellent biocompatibility and mechanical properties while enabling sustained drug release in the degenerative disc microenvironment, enhancing therapeutic outcomes. CHG@IL4I1-MNPs effectively regulate MΦ polarization by promoting M2 MΦ activation, thereby improving immune microenvironment balance. Animal studies demonstrated that CHG@IL4I1-MNPs alleviated symptoms of IDD, reduced inflammation, and supported tissue repair, highlighting its potential to reduce reliance on long-term medication and improve quality of life.

Among osteoporotic fractures, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) are the most common and can significantly impact patients’ quality of life. Growing evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in bone homeostasis by regulating osteoblast differentiation, bone metabolism, and remodeling processes. Notably, miR-147b-3p has been found to be downregulated in OVCF; however, its specific role in osteogenic regulation remains largely unknown. Therefore, further investigation is warranted to elucidate the function and underlying mechanism of miR-147b-3p in osteogenic differentiation. Methods: The GSE93883 and GSE74209 datasets were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to investigate specific microRNAs involved in the regulation of osteogenesis. Differential expression of miR-147b-3p and NDUFA4 was assessed between healthy controls and patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) using real-time quantitative PCR.To modulate the expression levels of miR-147b-3p in MC3T3-E1 cells, both the miR-147b-3p mimic and inhibitor were utilized. Cell viability was evaluated via the CCK-8 assay to assess the impact of miR-147b-3p on MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were conducted to quantify the expression levels of osteogenic markers across different experimental groups. Alizarin red staining (ARS) was employed to examine the effect of miR-147b-3p on the mineralization capacity of MC3T3-E1 cells. In vivo experiments were performed to evaluate the functional role of miR-147b-3p. Bioinformatics databases were used to predict the potential target gene of miR-147b-3p (NDUFA4), and the predictions were validated by a dual luciferase reporter gene assay.To investigate the regulatory role of the miR-147b-3p/NDUFA4 axis in osteogenic differentiation, MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with the NDUFA4 overexpression plasmid and miR-147b-3p mimic. Western blot analysis was performed to assess the phosphorylation levels of PI3K and AKT, in order to explore whether the miR-147b-3p/NDUFA4 axis regulates osteogenic differentiation through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Results: Our results indicated a significant downregulation of miR-147b-3p and a concurrent upregulation of NDUFA4 in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF). A luciferase reporter assay confirmed that NDUFA4 is a direct target gene of miR-147b-3p.To examine the functional role of miR-147b-3p, both in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted.The experimental findings revealed that the miR-147b-3p mimic significantly enhanced cell viability, increased protein expressions of Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and Runt-related Transcription Factor 2 (RUNX2), and promoted mineralization as evidenced by Alizarin Red S staining. Conversely, treatment with the miR-147b-3p inhibitor or overexpression plasmid for NDUFA4 (pNDUFA4) produced opposite effects.Furthermore, the miR-147b-3p/NDUFA4 axis was found to regulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.The miR-147b-3p mimic significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of PI3K (p-PI3K) and AKT (p-AKT), whereas pNDUFA4 led to their reduction. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that miR-147b-3p plays a crucial role in promoting osteogenic differentiation in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) by targeting NDUFA4 and modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000085003

The molecular mechanisms driving this form of metastasis are still largely unknown. PD-L1, an immune checkpoint protein, is central to tumor immune evasion and has become a focus for immunotherapy development. While PD-L1 inhibitors have shown success in various cancer types, their effectiveness in TNBC brain metastases remains to be fully investigated. This highlights the urgent need to understand the complex interactions between metastatic brain tumors and the tumor microenvironment in TNBC patients. Gaining insights into these dynamics is crucial for developing new targeted therapies, including those that modulate the PD-L1 pathway, to better manage and treat TNBC brain metastases. We explore the impact of Capsanthin on the tumor microenvironment of brain metastases in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our results reveal that Capsanthin effectively inhibits the migration of brain metastasis TNBC cells. Furthermore, Capsanthin significantly reduces the expression of EZH2 and N-linked glycosylated PD-L1 proteins and mRNA in TNBC cells, encompassing both primary and metastatic sites, as well as in mesenchymal stem cells (3A6). Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) indicate that elevated expression levels of EZH2 correlate with poorer patient prognosis. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate a direct interaction between EZH2 and PD-L1 in brain metastases of TNBC, underscoring the pivotal role of the EZH2-PD-L1 axis. Additionally, Capsanthin was found to suppress the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in metastatic brain TNBC cells and mesenchymal stem cells. Our results suggest that Capsanthin can modulate the tumor microenvironment and inhibit key pathways involved in cancer progression, offering potential therapeutic benefits for patients with TNBC brain metastases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000084286

Chronic inflammation is intricately linked to all stages of tumorigenesis and is therefore associated with an elevated risk of developing serious cancers. Epigenetic mechanisms have the capacity to trigger inflammation as well as facilitate tumor development and transformation within an inflammatory context. They achieve this by dynamically modulating the expression of both pro—inflammatory and anti—inflammatory cytokines, which in turn sustains chronic inflammation. The aberrant epigenetic landscape reconfigures the transcriptional programs of inflammatory and oncogenic genes. This reconfiguration is pivotal in dictating the biological functions of both tumor cells and immune cells. Aberrant histone H3 lysine 27 site (H3K27) methylation has been shown to be involved in biological behaviors such as inflammation development, tumor progression, and immune response. The establishment and maintenance of this repressive epigenetic mark is dependent on the involvement of the responsible histone modifying enzymes enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), jumonji domain containing 3 (JMJD3) and ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat gene X (UTX) as well as multiple cofactors. In addition, specific pharmacological agents have been shown to modulate H3K27 methylation levels, thereby modulating inflammation and carcinogenesis. This review comprehensively summarises the current characteristics and clinical significance of epigenetic regulation of H3K27 methylation in the context of inflammatory response and tumor progression. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000083695

Metabolic reprogramming, including changes in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), plays a critical role in MS pathophysiology. Previous studies identified reduced plasma α-dimorphecolic acid (α-DIPA), a linoleic acid derivative, in MS patients. This study investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of α-DIPA on microglia and the underlying pathways. Methods: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 microglial inflammation was used as an in vitro model. α-DIPA effects were assessed via ELISA for nitric oxide (NO) release, flow cytometry was used to examine cell proliferation, activation and polarization, and transcriptomic analysis was applied to identify key signaling pathways regulated by α-DIPA. Results: ELISA results showed that exogenous α-DIPA treatment significantly inhibited LPS-induced NO release from BV-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis suggested that 40 µM α-DIPA treatment significantly repressed LPS-induced BV-2 cell proliferation, activation, as well as M1 and M2 type polarization. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that exogenous α-DIPA extensively and drastically decreased the transcriptional level of numerous genes that are involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses, for instance, proinflammatory genes such as Tnf and Ccl3 related to IL-17 and TNF-α signaling. In addition, we also observed that the expression of multiple genes in NF-κB signaling were also inhibited greatly by α-DIPA, such as Nfkb2 and Nfkbia. Notably, α-DIPA robustly suppressed LPS-induced mRNA expression of abundant genes participating in the ferroptosis pathway, including Acsl4, Slc7a11, Me1, and Hmox1. Interestingly, the expressions of multiple ferroptosis-related genes were regulated specifically by α-DIPA but not LPS, such as Acsl5, Acsl6, Alox5, Cars, Dpp3, Dpp10, Slc2a5, and Slc7a1. Conclusion: α-DIPA inhibits microglial inflammation likely through regulating the pathways of the ferroptosis and NF-κB signaling. These results provided preliminary evidence for α-DIPA as a potential therapeutic candidate for neurodegenerative diseases like MS. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000082726

Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a critical membrane protein, plays a significant role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism. This study utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate the heterogeneity of cell subpopulations in RCI tissues and assess the regulatory effects of Cav-1. The findings revealed that Cav-1 expression negatively correlates with adipogenic activity, and its modulation through exercise or targeted therapies can significantly reduce adipocyte infiltration and enhance tissue repair. Further, Cav-1 knockout and overexpression models demonstrated the protein’s impact on key genes involved in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism, such as Scd1, fatty acid synthase (FASN), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Pparg). Animal studies corroborated these results, showing that exercise intervention increased Cav-1 expression, decreased adipocyte infiltration, and promoted structural repair. These insights suggest that targeting Cav-1 could offer a novel therapeutic strategy for improving RCI outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000082509

In our study, we aimed to demonstrate a new intravaginal injection technique, Cannulated Intravaginal Injection Technique (CIVIT) that we can perform vaginal injection more homogenously and less traumatic and more effectively to the entire vaginal mucosa. Retrospectively, the data of 44 patients who underwent intravaginal injection of HA manufactured for genital use at a private Female Health Clinic were analyzed. Of the 44 patients, 21 were injected using the random needling technique, and 22 were injected using CIVIT. All patients had symptoms of genitourinary syndrome (GUS), a vaginal health index below 15, and were compared based on the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) for GUS before and after the procedures. It was observed that all post-injection values, except for FSFI arousal (p = 0.539), were statistically significantly higher in the CIVIT group (P = 0.001). Post injection dryness, dyspareunia and discomfort values decreased significantly in the CIVIT group compared to the Random Needling group. Our new technique, CIVIT, and random injection, which is a frequently used technique, are two effective techniques for vaginal rejuvenation.

Effective and safe treatments need to be developed. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have demonstrated crucial roles in tissue regeneration, wound repair and inflammation regulation. However, the function is limited. The safety and efficacy of gene-modified MSCs is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether genetically modified MSCs with highly efficient expression of anti-inflammatory factors promote diabetic wound repair by regulating macrophage phenotype transition. This may provide a new approach to treating diabetic wound healing. Methods: In this study, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (hUMSCs) were genetically modified using recombinant lentiviral vectors to simultaneously overexpress three anti-inflammatory factors, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-13 (MSCs-3IL). Cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry and differentiation assay were used to detect the criteria of MSCs. Overexpression efficiency was evaluated using flow cytometry, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and cell scratch assay. We also assessed MSCs-3IL’s ability to modulate Raw264.7 macrophage phenotype using flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR. In addition, we evaluated diabetic wound healing through healing rate calculation, HE staining, Masson staining, and immunohistochemical analysis of PCNA, F4/80, CD31, CD86, CD206, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13. In addition, we evaluated the safety of the MSCs-3IL cells and the effect of the cells on several other models of inflammation. Results: MSCs-3IL efficiently expressed high levels of IL-4 and IL-10 (mRNA transcription increased by 15,000-fold and 800,000-fold, protein secretion 400 and 200 ng/mL), and IL-13 (mRNA transcription increased by 950,000-fold, protein secretion 6 ng/mL). MSCs-3IL effectively induced phenotypic polarization of pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages (M1) towards anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages (M2). The enhancement of function does not change the cell phenotype. The dynamic distribution in vivo was normal and no karyotype variation and tumor risk was observed. In a mouse diabetic wound model, MSCs-3IL promoted diabetic wound healing with a wound closure rate exceeding 96% after 14 days of cell treatment. The healing process was aided by altering macrophage phenotype (reduced CD86 and increased CD206 expression) and accelerating re-epithelialization. Conclusions: In summary, our study demonstrates that genetically modified hUMSCs effectively overexpressed three key anti-inflammatory factors (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13). MSCs-3IL-based therapy enhances diabetic wound healing with high efficiency and safety. This suggests that genetically modified hUMSCs could be used as a novel therapeutic approach for DFU repair. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000080441

However, abnormal anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations are frequent in infertility, suggesting that defects in the gonadotropin-independent period of folliculogenesis preceding cyclic recruitment (i.e., basal follicular growth) may often occur. We need to better understand basal follicular growth and determine how to improve it. Methods: Section I summarizes a literature search concerning preantral and early antral folliculogenesis, cyclic recruitment, and selection. Section II presents current knowledge about interventions involving early antral folliculogenesis and cyclic recruitment. Results: While folliculogenesis following cyclic recruitment is gonadotropin-dependent, basal follicular growth is not. Basal follicular growth is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone and local communication between the oocyte and its granulosa and thecal cells involving gap junctions and many autocrine/paracrine factors. This local communication sustains growth synergistically with follicle-stimulating hormone, but also suppresses this hormone to induce granulosa cell differentiation. As a follicle develops, its responsiveness to gonadotropin progressively increases. Section II describes 4 interventions affecting early antral folliculogenesis, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor priming, bromocriptine rebound, carbohydrate metabolism intervention, and danazol priming, which have improved embryo development and live birth rate in patients with previous failures. Conclusion: Basal follicular growth modulation can increase live birth rates. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000071324

In this investigation, a series of 7-mimic microRNAs was harnessed to induce the differentiation of Wharton’s jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (WJ-MSCs) into hepatocyte-like cells (HLC) through the application of two distinct techniques: transfection agents and electroporation. The results were then compared with those of HLCs differentiated through the consumption of chemical compounds. Results: Different time points (48 h, 72 h, and 96 h), unlike concentrations of mimic miRNAs (100 pM, and 200 pM), and dissimilar combinations of mimic-miRNAs (4-mimic and 7-mimic miRNAs) were selected to assess the stage of differentiated cells through electroporation and lipofection methods. For chemical differentiation, a two-step chemical hepatic differentiation protocol was used (for 21 days). The expression level of eleven key genes that were selected to estimate the stage of produced HLCs by each method were tested at different time points, concentrations and combination of mimic-miRNA. Results demonstrated that the 7-miR-mimics/72 h culture method by electroporation, then the 7-miR-mimics/72 h culture method by lipofection, and finally the chemical differentiation (72 h culture) showed the best result for differentiation. Furthermore, the period in which HLCs are maintained under culture conditions is important, as prolonged culture (more than 72 h) leads to cell loss. Conclusion: In conclusion, the results demonstrated that the 7-miR cocktail delivered by electroporation after 72 h effectively promoted the acquisition of hepatocyte-like characteristics which was evidenced by a significant decrease in the Oct4 stemness factor and an increase in the expression of ALB, TAT, AAT, CYP, G6P and HNF4A. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000070390

As no therapy modifies disease progression long-term, there is an immense clinical need for novel therapies. The joints are innervated by alpha calcitonin gene-related peptide (αCGRP)- and substance P (SP)-positive sensory nerve fibers. Both neuropeptides have trophic effects on target cells within the joints. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of SP- and αCGRP-expressing intra-articular (i.a.) applied rat(r)BMSC on cartilage and subchondral bone structural changes after OA induction. Methods: Mice were subjected to destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery, followed by i.a. injections with rBMSC, transduced with lacZ, SP or αCGRP. 2, 8 and 16 weeks after DMM/Sham surgery, motion analysis and serum marker analysis were performed. Cartilage and subchondral bone properties were assessed by OA scoring, atomic force microscopy and nano-CT analysis. Results: OARSI scores of the medial cartilage compartments indicated induction and progression of OA after DMM surgery in all groups. Differences between the treatment groups were mostly restricted to the lateral cartilage compartments, where αCGRP caused a decrease of structural changes. DMM-rBMSC-αCGRP or -SP mice displayed decreased cartilage stiffness in the cartilage middle zone. DMM-rBMSC-αCGRP mice revealed improved mobility, whereas Sham-rBMSC-SP mice revealed reduced mobility compared to rBMSC-lacZ. With respect to condyle length, subarticular bone and ephiphyseal bone morphology, DMM-rBMSC-SP mice had more alterations indicating either a more progressed OA stage or a more severe OA pathology compared to controls. In addition, DMM-rBMSC-SP mice developed osteophytes already 8 weeks after surgery. Adiponectin serum level was increased in DMM-rBMSC-αCGRP mice, and MIP1b level in DMM-rBMSC-SP mice. Notably, pain and inflammation markers increased over time in rBMSC-SP mice while rBMSC-αCGRP mice revealed a bell-shaped curve with a peak at 8 weeks. Conclusions: We conclude that i.a. injection of rBMSC in general have a beneficial effect on cartilage matrix structure, subchondral bone microarchitecture and inflammation. rBMSC-αCGRP have anabolic and possible analgesic properties and may attenuate the progression or severity of OA. In contrast, rBMSC-SP exert a more catabolic influence on knee joints of both, Sham and DMM mice, making it a potential candidate for inhibition studies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000064623

To address these issues, we developed a multifunctional hydrogel (GelMA/PNS/Alg@IGF-1) that integrates gelatine methacryloyl (GelMA), Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), and sodium alginate microspheres encapsulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). This hydrogel was engineered to achieve gradient and sustained release of bioactive agents to target senescence and promote vascular repair. In vitro studies demonstrated that the hydrogel significantly reduced oxidative stress, suppressed senescence markers and senescence-associated secretory phenotypes, and restored endothelial cell function under high-glucose conditions by inhibiting NF-κB pathway activation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the modulation of pathways linked to inflammation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. This hydrogel accelerated diabetic wound closure in a rat model in vivo and enhanced collagen deposition, granulation tissue formation, and neovascularization. Furthermore, the hydrogel mitigated oxidative stress and cellular senescence and promoted tissue remodelling. The synergistic effects of PNS and IGF-1 within the hydrogel established a pro-regenerative microenvironment to address both pathological ageing and vascular dysfunction. These findings highlight GelMA/PNS/Alg@IGF-1 as a promising therapeutic platform for diabetic wound management, as this material offers dual anti-senescence and proangiogenic efficacy to overcome the complexities of chronic wound healing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000062072

We aimed to identify novel TAM-related biomarkers and significance of macrophage infiltration in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) through an integrative analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. To describe the cell atlas and construct a novel prognostic signature in LUAD. Methods: The gene signature linked to TAMs was identified utilizing Scanpy from the scRNA-seq dataset GSE131907. Subsequent analysis involved evaluating the expression levels of these genes, their potential molecular mechanisms, and prognostic significance in LUAD using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. We also constructed a risk score models through LASSO Cox regression for these genes. The underlying mechanism was further elucidated through the application of GSEA, ESTIMATE, TIDE, and other bioinformatic algorithms. Results: Single-cell atlas was described by analyze 29 scRNA-seq samples from 19 LUAD patients. The TAMs-related gene signature (TGS) was identified as an independent prognostic factor by LASSO Cox regression analysis using differential expression genes (DEGs) derived from pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophage cells. Risk score model including nine TAMs-related genes (FOSL1, ZNF697, ADM, UBE2S, TICAM1, S100P, BIRC3, TLE1, and DEFB1) were obtained for prognosis construction. Moreover, the risk model underwent additional validation in four external GEO cohorts: GSE31210, GSE72094, GSE26939, and GSE30219. Interestingly, TGS-high tumors revealed enrichments in TGF-β signaling and hypoxia pathways, which shown low immune infiltration and immunosuppression by ESTIMATE and TIDE algorithm. The TGS-high risk group exhibited lower richness and diversity in the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Conclusion: This study introduces a novel TGS score developed through LASSO Cox regression analysis, utilizing DEGs in pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophage cells. High TGS tumors exhibited enrichment in TGF-β signaling and hypoxia pathways, suggesting their potential utility in predicting prognosis and immune responses in patients with LUAD.

Extracellular vesicle-derived miRNAs may serve as biomarkers to distinguish septic shock from non-septic shock, providing a more accurate diagnostic tool for postsurgical patients. This study aims to identify extracellular vesicle-derived miRNA signatures that differentiate septic shock from non-septic shock in postsurgical patients, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making. Methods: A multicentre, prospective study was conducted on miRNA profiles in shock patients. Two cohorts were recruited from the Intensive Care Units of two Spanish hospitals: a discovery cohort with 109 patients and a validation cohort with 52 patients. Plasma samples were collected within 24 h of shock diagnosis and subjected to miRNA sequencing. High-throughput sequencing data from the discovery cohort were analysed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. These findings were validated via qPCR in the validation cohort. Results: Thirty miRNAs were identified as significantly differentially expressed between septic and non-septic shock patients. Among these, six miRNAs—miR-100-5p, miR-484, miR-10a-5p, miR-148a-3p, miR-342-3p, and miR-451a—demonstrated strong diagnostic capabilities for septic shock. A combination of miR-100-5p, miR-148a-3p, and miR-451a achieved an area under the curve of 0.894, with qPCR validation in the validation cohort yielding an area under the curve of 0.960. Conclusions: This study highlights extracellular vesicle-derived miRNAs as promising biomarkers for differentiating septic from non-septic shock. The identified three-miRNA signature has significant potential to enhance septic shock diagnosis, thereby aiding in timely and appropriate treatment for postsurgical patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000060887

Moreover, there is little evidence on its relationship with psychological and family adjustment. Therefore, the aims of this study were to: (1) validate the self-care scale for adults and (2) analyse its external validity, verifying its relationship with general psychological and family adjustment variables. Methods: The sample was constituted by 971 parents (56.5% women) with children in early childhood (0–5 years) aged 23–58 years (M = 38.11). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, correlations and Student’s t mean contrasts were carried out. Results: Good fit indices for the scale, which presented a bifactor structure composed of physical and psychological self-care. Both types of self-care were directly related to life satisfaction and positive affect; on the other hand, they were negatively related to parental stress, the presence of family-work conflict, and the guilt related to such conflict. The mothers reflected lower levels of psychological self-care. Conclusions: The developed questionnaire is a valid instrument that can be useful in the measurement of self-care in adults and particularly in parents of young children.

Proper control of pluripotency and differentiation is vital for generating high-quality cardiomyocytes and repairing damaged myocardium. Cathepsin K, a lysosomal cysteine protease, is a potential target for cardiovascular disease treatment; however, its role in cardiomyocyte differentiation and regeneration is unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects and mechanisms of cathepsin K inhibition on the differentiation of human embryonic stem cell-induced cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and myocardial generation. Methods: We cultured H9-hESCs in CDM3 medium to induce myocardial differentiation, adding cathepsin K inhibitor II (1 μM) on days 2, 5 and 8, respectively. Cells were observed and collected 48 h after each treatment. The morphology and contractile clusters of H9-hESCs were tracked with microscopy and video recording. Pluripotency and cardiac markers were assessed at each stage of differentiation. We also examined glucose and lipid metabolism, mitochondrion-related markers, apoptosis and autophagy. Results: CDM3 medium effectively differentiated high-density H9-hESCs into mature, spontaneously contracting cardiomyocytes. Cathepsin K inhibition accelerates the differentiation of H9-hESCs into cardiac mesoderm and cardiac precursor cells (CPCs) by reducing apoptosis, decreasing glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism at the early and middle stages, and subsequently facilitate the development and differentiation of cardiomyocytes by enhancing glucolipid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation at the late stage. Meanwhile, cathepsin K inhibition enhanced mitochondrial function and lysosome-related gene transcription during the differentiation process. Conclusion: Our study highlights the potential of cathepsin K inhibition for renewable cardiomyocytes and suggests exploring metabolic pathways and signaling to improve cardiac regeneration and organoid development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000056706

Serum S100A9 and CCL5 levels were measured in 123 patients newly diagnosed with NPC and 107 patients without NPC. Additionally, 38 patients (19 with NPC and 19 without) were recruited from Xiangya Hospital as an external validation cohort. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for NPC. Variable selection was conducted using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. NPC prediction models were developed using four machine-learning algorithms, and their performance was evaluated with ROC curves. Calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and Shapley additive explanation plots were employed for further evaluation and interpretation. Serum S100A9 and CCL5 levels were significantly elevated in patients with NPC compared with patients without NPC. Multivariate logistic regression identified S100A9, CCL5, TP, and ALB as independent predictors of NPC. ROC analysis demonstrated that S100A9 had superior diagnostic performance compared to CCL5 and other blood indicators, effectively differentiating NPC from non-NPC cases. A machine-learning-based logistic regression model incorporating S100A9, CCL5, ALB, GLB, and PLR demonstrated a reliable diagnostic value for NPC, achieving an Area under the curve (AUC) of 0.877 in the training cohort. The calibration curve showed excellent agreement between predicted and actual probabilities; in contrast, the DCA curve highlighted strong clinical utility. The model also performed well in the external validation cohort, with an AUC of 0.817. Serum levels of S100A9, CCL5, and other indicators such as GLB, ALB, and PLR have diagnostic values for NPC.

Cardiomyocyte cell death, particularly through apoptosis, necroptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, is pivotal in myocardial I/R injury. Preventing cell death during the process of I/R is vital for improving ischemic cardiomyopathy. These multiple forms of cell death can occur simultaneously, interact with each other, and contribute to the complexity of myocardial I/R injury. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive summary of the key molecular mechanisms and regulatory patterns involved in these five types of cell death in myocardial I/R injury. We will also discuss the crosstalk and intricate interactions among these mechanisms, highlighting the interplay between different types of cell death. Furthermore, we will explore specific molecules or targets that participate in different cell death pathways and elucidate their mechanisms of action.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), as progenitors of the hematopoietic system, are critical for the continuous renewal and regulation of immune cells. Therefore, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms governing HSC fate and differentiation in microgravity environments is of paramount importance. Methods: In this study, hindlimb unloading (HU) was employed in mice to simulate microgravity conditions. After 28 days of HU, cells were isolated for analysis. Flow cytometry and colony-forming assays were utilized to assess changes in HSC proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, transcriptomic and untargeted metabolomic sequencing were performed to elucidate alterations in the metabolic pathways of the bone marrow microenvironment and their molecular regulatory effects on HSCs fate. Results: Our findings revealed that 28 days of HU impaired hematopoietic function, leading to multi-organ damage and hematological disorders. The simulated microgravity environment significantly increased the HSCs population in the bone marrow, particularly within the long-term and short-term subtypes, while severely compromising the differentiation capacity of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Transcriptomic analysis of HSCs, combined with metabolomic profiling of bone marrow supernatants, identified 1,631 differentially expressed genes and 58 metabolites with altered abundance. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated that HU suppressed key pathways, including hematopoietic cell lineage and MAPK signaling. Furthermore, integrated analyses revealed that metabolites affected by HU, particularly hypoxanthine enriched in the purine metabolism pathway, were closely associated with hematopoietic cell lineage and MAPK signaling pathways. Molecular docking simulations and in vitro experiments confirmed that hypoxanthine interacts directly with core molecules within these pathways, influencing their expression. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that hypoxanthine in the bone marrow supernatant acts as a signaling mediator under microgravity, influencing HSCs fate by modulating hematopoietic cell lineage and MAPK signaling pathways. This study offers novel insights into the impact of microgravity on HSC fate and gene expression, underscoring the pivotal role of bone marrow microenvironmental metabolic changes in regulating key signaling pathways that determine hematopoietic destiny. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000048542

This systematic review aims to synthesize the existing evidence on the association between the (TyG) index, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone fractures. Method: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases was performed for studies published up to December 26, 2024. Inclusion criteria encompassed human studies examining the TyG index in relation to BMD or fractures. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Data synthesis included both qualitative and descriptive statistical analyses. Results: From 201 studies identified, 12 met the inclusion criteria comprising 817,242 participants. Most studies reported a significant association between TyG index and bone fractures. The studies reported inconsistent findings regarding the association between the TyG index and BMD. While some studies found no correlation between the TyG index and BMD in individuals aged ≥ 50 years, studies on the general population aged ≥ 18 years demonstrated a significant correlation between the TyG index and BMD. Variations in the age of study populations, the presence of diabetes, BMI, and adjustment factors likely contributed to these discrepancies. Further research is needed to clarify the role of the TyG index in bone health and its potential utility as a surrogate marker. Conclusion: The TyG index is associated with bone fractures and can serve as a surrogate marker for osteoporosis in the general populations rather than exclusively for the elderly. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000042381

This study derived MSCs from the amniotic fluid (AF-MSCs) of seven first-trimester pregnancies, characterized them through flow cytometry, and evaluated their osteogenic differentiation potential before expanding the cells to compare immunoregulatory gene expression in proliferative and senescent states. Additionally, an assessment of the adipogenic differentiation potential of AF-MSCs from three samples was conducted following their recovery from approximately 9 months of cryopreservation, with results showing that these recovered cells retain the capacity for adipogenic differentiation. Molecular analysis revealed no significant differences in the expression of key immunoregulatory genes, such as TGFβ, IL-10, IDO, and VCAM-1, between proliferative and senescent cells, although senescent cells showed downregulation of FASL and upregulation of IL-6, COX1, and HLA-G. Markers of cell proliferation, including FOXM1 and B-MYB, were significantly downregulated in senescent cells, confirming the progression of replicative senescence. Despite expectations, the results indicated that some immunomodulatory markers remained stable or were even enhanced in senescent AF-MSCs. These findings highlight the resilience of AF-MSC immunomodulatory properties during prolonged in vitro expansion, supporting their potential for therapeutic applications despite the challenges posed by replicative senescence. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000041615

Herein, we examined the underlying molecular mechanism via which Doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic agent used for NB treatment, promotes proangiogenic response in the SH-SY5Y microenvironment. Doxorubicin treatment at 1 µg/ml reduced SH-SY5Y cell proliferation and primed the apoptosis pathway. Unexpectedly, SH-SY5Y cells treated with doxorubicin upregulated their expression of the pro-angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelets-derived growth factor (PDGF), and matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) and secretion of nitric oxide. To assess the functional angiogenesis of SH-SY5Y cells pre-treated with doxorubicin, an indirect co-culture system with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was established. These HUVECs acquired enhanced proliferation, migration capacity, and tube formation capability and exhibited increased nitric oxide (NO) production, in addition to upregulated α-smooth muscle actin expression, suggesting enhanced contractility. In-ovo studies of the neo-angiogenic response of SH-SY5Y pre-treated with doxorubicin further show their promoted neo-angiogenesis as indicated by the generated blood vessels and histological analysis of CD31 expression. Inhibition of PHD-2 could be a potential target for doxorubicin, as indicated by molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and MM-GBSA calculations, leading to hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) stabilization. Bioinformatics analyses and enrichment analyses of RNA-seq data revealed activation of Pi3K pathway which is further validated in-vitro. These results provide evidence of the unexpected pro-angiogenic response of SH-SY5Y cells to doxorubicin treatment and suggest the potential use of multi-modal therapeutic regimens for a more comprehensive approach to NB treatment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000041258

Our aim was to explore the mechanism through which the MIF pathway regulates salidroside-mediated resistance to hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Methods: Ligation surgery of the left anterior descending branch of the coronary artery was employed to establish a myocardial infarction mouse model. Salidroside at low and high doses was administered to the mice for 4 weeks after the surgery. Cardiac function was evaluated via echocardiography. Morphological changes, apoptosis, and mitochondrial damage in the myocardium were examined. For the cell experiments, cardiomyocytes were treated with salidroside under oxygen‒glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions and were either treated with recombinant MIF (rMIF) or transfected with Mif-siRNA. Subsequently, mitochondrial quality control and apoptosis were assessed. Results: Salidroside enhanced mitochondrial quality control in MI model mice, mitigated apoptosis and improved cardiac dysfunction. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that there were fewer damaged mitochondria in the salidroside-treated mice compared with the control mice. MIF and downstream mitochondrial quality control pathways were activated in the mice treated with salidroside. Consistently, the cell experiments demonstrated that salidroside and rMIF alleviated apoptosis, improved impaired mitochondrial quality control in OGD-induced cells and activated MIF signaling in OGD-induced cells. However, these effects of salidroside were partially blocked by Mif-siRNA transfection. Conclusion: Salidroside alleviated myocardial apoptosis and ameliorated cardiac dysfunction in MI model mice through the MIF pathway and downstream mitochondrial quality control. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000038435

Therefore, it is necessary to identify prognostic factors associated with the biological heterogeneity of CRC in order to improve patients' survival expectations. Methods: We obtained and merged RNA-Seq data along with clinical details for colorectal cancer (CRC) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repository, and then performed immunocluster typing on all CRC specimens. We conducted differential expression gene (DEG) analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and tumor microenvironment (TME) analysis on CRC samples that were divided into high and low Immunity categories. Moreover, we pinpointed prognostic genes from immune-related gene (IRGs) sets, developed a prognostic risk model, and executed survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and independent prognostic analysis. Additionally, we assessed the risk for patients categorized into high- and low-risk groups based on the model. Lastly, we created a Nomogram to customize the prediction of survival outcomes in CRC patients. Results: CRC samples were divided into high and low Immunity groups based on the median value of the immunity score. Between the two groups, a total of 1550 DEGs were identified and 395 differentially expressed immune-related genes (DE-IRGs) were identified by intersection with 2483 IRGs. The DE-IRGs of the high Immunity group were dominated by Cytokine receptor interactions, chemokine signaling pathways and immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and molecule function of immune effector process. TME analysis showed that most of the 27 immune cells and functions were highly enriched in high Immunity group, whose Immune Score, Stromal Score and ESTIMATE Score were significantly higher. Subsequently, a prognostic risk model of CRC was constructed based on 12 prognostic genes, and the accuracy and reliability of the model prediction were verified. Finally, Nomogram enabled accurate individual prediction of the survival prognosis of CRC patients. Conclusions: Our study develops an immune-related prognostic model and Nomogram that reliably predicts survival outcomes in CRC patients and enhances understanding of the tumor immunity and molecular mechanisms of CRC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-86000001777

Erectile dysfunction (ED), a common condition in andrology, is frequently associated with DM. The incidence of diabetes mellitus-induced ED (DMED) is second only to the cardiovascular complications of diabetes. Compared to other types of ED, DMED presents with more severe symptoms, rapid progression, and notable resistance to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5is). Various forms of programmed cell death (PCD)—including apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis—play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of DMED. An exacerbation of DMED is linked to critical irritants like advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the corpus cavernosum tissue. These irritants can spark anomalous activations of diverse PCDs, which damage primary corpus cavernosum cells like cavernous nerve cells, endothelial cells, and myocytes, leading to ED. Hence, we reviewed current knowledge on the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of targeting PCDs in DMED, aiming to advance strategies for enhancing erectile function. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219756229

The canonical signaling pathway activated by Wnt1, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade, also plays a crucial protective role in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the relationship between Wnt1/β-catenin signaling and microglial activation remains unclear. Our study focused on understanding the impact and mechanism of Wnt1 on microglial activation. Methods and results: To simulate neuroinflammatory conditions in vitro, BV2 cells were exposed to 1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide. CD86- and CD206-positive cells were identified by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assays. Inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Autophagy was analyzed by expression of LC3B puncta, LC3, P62, and beclin1 expression. The inflammatory activation suppressed by rhWnt1 was restricted by DKK1, siRNA-β-catenin and siRNA-LKB1, respectively, with concomitant changes in β-catenin expression and phosphorylation of NFκB-p65, LKB1, and AMPK. Although the anti-inflammatory effect of Wnt1/LKB1 pathway was independent of β-catenin, Wnt1/LKB1 regulated β-catenin. The reduced inflammation caused by rhWnt1 is linked to its enhancement of autophagy, a process blocked by siRNA-LKB1 and 3-MA partially. Conclusions: The anti-inflammatory effects of Wnt1 on BV2 cells improved autophagy, a mechanism partly dependent on the β-catenin pathway or the phosphorylation of LKB1. Furthermore, the Wnt1/LKB1 pathway was activated independently of β-catenin and participated in regulating its expression. Our research unveils a previously unknown method through which Wnt1 exerts its anti-inflammatory effects, which may have a potential protective role against CNS diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219648385

Current treatments, such as anti-androgen drugs and minoxidil, show heterogeneous effects, even with long-term application. Meanwhile, the large-scale adoption of other adjuvant therapies has been slow, partly due to insufficient mechanistic evidence. A major barrier to developing better treatment for AGA is the incomplete understanding of its pathogenesis. The predominant academic consensus is that AGA is caused by abnormal expression of androgens and their receptors in individuals with a genetic predisposition. Emerging evidence suggests the contributing role of factors such as immune responses, oxidative stress, and microbiome changes, which were not previously given due consideration. Immune-mediated inflammation and oxidative stress disrupt hair follicles’ function and damage the perifollicular niche, while scalp dysbiosis influences local metabolism and destabilizes the local microenvironment. These interconnected mechanisms collectively contribute to AGA pathogenesis. These additional aspects enhance our current understanding and confound the conventional paradigm, bridging the gap in developing holistic solutions for AGA. In this review, we gather existing evidence to discuss various etiopathogenetic factors involved in AGA and their possible interconnections, aiming to lay the groundwork for the future identification of therapeutic targets and drug development. Additionally, we summarize the advantages and disadvantages of AGA research models, ranging from cells and tissues to animals, to provide a solid basis for more effective mechanistic studies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219647464

Through transcriptomic profiling, histological analyses, and functional assessment, we demonstrate that antioxidant-driven tissue remodeling enhances epithelialization, neovascularization, and extracellular matrix organization, thereby improving graft stability and biomechanical properties.

We enhanced the osteogenic activity of the induced membrane (IM) by incorporating bone marrow fluid, leading to spontaneous osteogenesis (SO). We aimed to explore the application of this method in tibiofibular fusion (TFF) for reconstructing segmental tibial defects. Methods: Forty-two rats with femoral defects were divided into seven groups (n = 6). Defects in groups A1-3 and B1-3 were filled with polymethylmethacrylate spacers while Group B4 was the control. Kirschner wires were used in Groups A1 and B1, plating was used in Groups A3 and B3-4, while the medullary canal was sealed in Groups A2 and B2. In Group A, osteogenic activity was measured using immunohistochemistry, W-B, and qRT-PCR. In Group B, the osteogenic results were measured using X-ray and gross examinations. Ten patients with 4–10 cm segmental defects of the middle and distal tibia underwent reconstruction using the IM technique, and IM and bone marrow fluid-induced SO for TFF, whose effects were assessed. Results: At five weeks, Group A1 showed higher levels of BMSCs and expression of BMP-2 and TGF-β1 than Groups A2 and A3 (p < 0.05). After 12 weeks, Group B1 had more new bone at the bone end than Group B3 (p = 0.009) whereas Groups B2 and B4 did not. All tibial defects and TFF healed. The TFF site and posterior tibia healed faster than the other sides and showed quicker clinical healing (p < 0.05). All patients could fully bear weight before tibial clinical healing, with an excellent-to-good functional rate of 80% (Paley’s criterion) at the 13 – to 36-month follow-up. Conclusion: Bone marrow fluid enhances the osteogenic activity of IMs leading to SO. TFF by SO progresses faster than tibial clinical healing, making the IM technique an effective stabilizer for faster and better functional recovery after reconstruction of segmental defects of the middle and distal tibia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219645630

Methods: The literature related to osteosarcoma and cure which were published from January 2014 to December 2023 were retrieved from the database of WoSCC and made an overall analysis for the papers published including number of articles, distribution of countries and institutions, author information, and keywords, with the CiteSpace 6.2.R5. Results: A total of 3131 papers were retrieved, including 2601 articles and 530 reviews, and the number of papers published has been increasing year by year in the last decade. There were 415 countries and 10,719 research institutions participating into the study. China’s output of literature was the highest relying on its 1490 papers published, followed by The United States (548 papers). Shanghai Jiaotong university had the largest number of papers published (121 papers) and Central South University ranked second (82 papers). A total of 16,816 authors participated in the study. The number of the paper published by Massimo Serra of the Rizzoli Orthopaedics Institute was the largest (27 papers), followed by Dominique Heymann of the University of Sheffield (20 papers). The visualization analysis of keywords by CiteSpace software showed that the drug resistance, drug delivery, tumor tissue engineering and gene expression have become hotspots in the field of osteosarcoma treatment. Drug resistance significantly limits the effectiveness of current cancer treatments. Drug delivery technology not only enhances the targeting and efficacy of drugs but also helps to overcome drug resistance. The stem cells, targeted therapy, and tumor microenvironment represent the new research trends. In particular, the tumor microenvironment plays a key role in tumor development, progression, and drug resistance, and it offers numerous potential therapeutic targets. Conclusion: Our investigation has identified key research foci and hotspots in osteosarcoma treatment, including drug resistance mechanisms, innovations in drug delivery technology, stem cell development, tumor microenvironment analysis, the development of novel therapies, and the clinical translation of tumor tissue engineering. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219641632

Skeletal muscle comprises two main stem cells: muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). FAPs are essential for maintaining the regenerative milieu of muscle tissue and modulating the activation of muscle satellite cells. However, during acute skeletal muscle injury, the alterations and mechanisms of action of FAPs remain unclear. Methods: we employed the GEO database for bioinformatics analysis of skeletal muscle injury. A skeletal muscle injury model was established through cardiotoxin (CTX, 10µM, 50µL) injection into the tibialis anterior (TA) of C57BL/6 mice. Three days post-injury, we extracted the TA, isolated FAPs (CD31−CD45−PDGFRα+Sca-1+), and assessed the senescence phenotype through SA-β-Gal staining and Western blot. Additionally, we established a co-culture system to evaluate the capacity of FAPs to facilitate MuSCs differentiation. Finally, we alleviated the senescent of FAPs through in vitro (100 µM melatonin, 5 days) and in vivo (20 mg/kg/day melatonin, 15 days) administration experiments, confirming melatonin’s pivotal role in the regeneration and repair processes of skeletal muscle. Results: In single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, we discovered the upregulation of senescence-related pathways in FAPs following injury. Immunofluorescence staining revealed the co-localization of FAPs and senescent markers in injured muscles. We established the CTX injury model and observed a reduction in the number of FAPs post-injury, accompanied by the manifestation of a senescent phenotype. Melatonin treatment was found to attenuate the injury-induced senescence of FAPs. Further co-culture experiments revealed that melatonin facilitated the restoration of FAPs’ capacity to promote myoblast differentiation. Through GO and KEGG analysis, we found that the administration of melatonin led to the upregulation of AMPK pathway in FAPs, a pathway associated with antioxidant stress response. Finally, drug administration experiments corroborated that melatonin enhances skeletal muscle regeneration and repair by alleviating FAP senescence in vivo. Conclusion: In this study, we first found FAPs underwent senescence and redox homeostasis imbalance after injury. Next, we utilized melatonin to enhance FAPs regenerative and repair capabilities by activating AMPK signaling pathway. Taken together, this work provides a novel theoretical foundation for treating skeletal muscle injury. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219640156

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are pivotal for post-transcriptional regulation in various tumors. However, the aberrantly expressed RBP genes and their regulatory patterns in KS remain unclear. This study aimed to identify relevant RBP genes in KS and assess the potential functions and molecular interactions of RPS27, a dysregulated RBP in KS tissues, Methods: Matched KS lesions and normal control tissues from ten patients were chosen for the study. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were first identified by RNA-sequencing, and results were validated through an independent public RNA-seq dataset (GSE147704). Among the DEGs, RBPs were selected for further analysis, with RPS27 chosen for detailed investigation due to its dysregulation in KS tissues. RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry were employed to validate RPS27 expression. Cellular experiments were conducted for dysregulated RPS27 to explore its functions. Additionally, improved RNA immunoprecipitation (iRIP)-seq was performed to investigate potential binding interactions of RPS27 in KS. Results: We identified 828 DEGs through RNA-seq, with 367 overlapping DEGs confirmed by the public RNA-seq dataset. We obtained 48 RBP genes from the overlapping DEGs, including 3 upregulated (PCBP3, L1TD1, and PEG10) and 45 downregulated RBP genes in KS. Notably, downregulated RBPs included TECR, PUSL1, DQX1, MAT1A, RACK1, EEF1A2, and EEF1B2, and the remaining downregulated RBPs were all ribosomal protein genes, including RPS27, which was selected for further exploration. Cellular experiments confirmed that RPS27 inhibition could promote cellular proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of HUVECs, consistent with its downregulation in KS. iRIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses showed RPS27’s ability to selectively bind to 26 DEGs and showed correlation. The majority of RPS27-bound DEGs were ribosomal protein genes, including RPL8, RPL13, RPL13A, RPL18, RPL19, RPL23, RPLP1, RPL27A, RPL40, RPS2, RPS4X, RPS13, RPS18, RPS21, and RPS27, which were associated with viral transcription and gene expression. Conclusion: Our results identified dysregulated RBP genes in KS and explored the cellular functions and molecular targets of RPS27, indicating its potential regulatory role in KS development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219639356

The purpose of this study is to determine whether muscle biopsy reveals predictive information about the success rate of patients undergoing diabetic major lower limb amputation. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted among diabetic patients who underwent below-knee amputation. Skin-subcutaneous and muscle biopsy samples were obtained during the operation from 62 patients who undergo major limb amputation. Depending on the complications after surgery, patients were assigned into three groups: Group 1 consisted of patients with adequate wound healing without any complications; Group 2 included patients with prolonged wound healing requiring additional interventions like debridement; and Group 3 consisted of patients who underwent reamputation at a more proximal level. Biopsy samples of the groups were compared regarding degenerative cells, inflammatory cells, and the presence of infection. Results: There was a significant difference between Groups 1 and 3 regarding the presence of abscess formation and infection (p < 001). Comparison of Groups 1 and 3 revealed significant differences regarding inflammatory cell count, respectively (p < 001). According to the results of the ROC analysis performed for histopathologic cellular evaluation, 15% for inflammatory cell ratio in muscle samples and 25% for degenerative cell ratio both in muscle and skin samples were determined as cut-off values. Conclusions: The presence of increased degenerative cell count and infection in muscle biopsy areassociated with higher rates of reoperation.

Previous studies have shown the role of epigenetic changes in aging and cancer development, but the role of RNA pseudouridine (Ψ) modification in aging and cancer remains to be explored. Results: Using bulk RNA sequencing, CRC cells with low Ψ writers expression levels have higher CS levels. We developed the Psi Score for assessing the transcriptomic profile of RNA Ψ modification regulation and found that the Psi Score correlates with CS. Furthermore, Psi-related senescence may be mediated by mTOR, TGF-β, TNF-α, and inflammatory response signaling pathways. Meanwhile, Psi Score could predict the anti-cancer treatment outcomes of anti-aging interventions and could be used to predict the response to immunotherapy. Conclusions: Overall, these findings reveal that RNA Ψ modification connected aging and cancer and provided novel insights into biomarker-guided cancer regimens. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219631547

This process is initially a protective measure characterized by enhanced fibroblasts, which are responsible for producing extracellular matrix proteins that provide structural support to the heart. However, when fibrosis becomes excessive, it can lead to adverse outcomes, including increasing tissue stiffness and impaired cardiac function, which can ultimately result in heart failure with a poor prognosis. While fibroblasts are the primary cells involved in cardiac fibrosis, immune cells have also been found to play a vital role in its progression. Recent research has shown that immune cells exert multifaceted effects besides regulation of inflammatory response. Advanced research techniques such as single-cell sequencing and multiomics have provided insights into the specific subsets of immune cells involved in fibrosis and the complex regulation of the process. Targeted immunotherapy against fibrosis is gaining traction as a potential treatment option, but it is still unclear how immune cells achieve this regulation and whether distinct subsets are involved in different roles. To better understand the role of immune cells in cardiac fibrosis, it is essential to examine the classical signaling pathways that are closely related to fibrosis formation. We have also focused on the unique properties of diverse immune cells in cardiac fibrosis and their specific intercommunications. Therefore, this review will delve into the plasticity and heterogeneity of immune cells and their specific roles in cardiac fibrosis, which propose insights to facilitate the development of anti-fibrosis therapeutic strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219629543

Methods: A total of 130 patients with advanced BC were selected for the study. Samples of normal breast tissue, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive carcinoma were collected. The expression levels of CCN5 and ER in these tissues were examined using immunohistochemical methods. The correlation between expression of CCN5 and ER in different tissues and also differences in expression in invasive carcinoma were analysed. In addition, the relationship between CCN5 expression in advanced BC tissues and clinical pathological features was examined. Results: CCN5 and ER had low expression in normal breast tissues and invasive carcinoma tissues, but high expression in DCIS, with this difference being statistically significant (X2 = 119.899, P < 0.001; X2 = 113.524, P < 0.001, respectively). The expression of CCN5 and ER in different tissues of patients with advanced BC showed a positive correlation. Significant differences were also observed in the positive and negative expression of CCN5 and ER (X2 = 56.358, P < 0.001).

This study is aimed to explore the role of MPO and the regulatory effect of umbilical cord-derived MSCs on MPO expression in monocytes in AS. Methods: MPO mRNA expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was detected by Real-time PCR. Cytokines including IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-17 A, IL-4, IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-α were determined by flow cytometry. A co-culture system was established by culturing THP-1 cells with MSCs at a ratio of 5:1. Results: Increased mRNA expression of MPO was observed in PBMCs of AS patients compared to healthy controls (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of MPO was positively associated with C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P < 0.05) in AS. Besides, the levels of IL-2, IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-17 A, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-α in plasma were notably increased in AS (P < 0.05). Positive correlations between MPO expression and IL-2, IFN -γ, IL-4, TNF-α as well as IL-6 were demonstrated in AS (P < 0.05). Furthermore, MSCs remarkably suppressed the mRNA expression of MPO along with the secretion of IL-17 A and TNF-α, but promoted IL-10 generation in monocytes. Conclusion: MPO expression is significantly upregulated and correlates with cytokine imbalance in AS. It may serve as a valuable immunotherapeutic target for AS.

The long-term use of DAPT is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, which affects morbidity and mortality. Risk stratification scores have been developed to predict this risk and provide a balance against the risk of ischemic events. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of bleeding in a cohort of patients in Kenya on DAPT and assess the performance of the PRECISE-DAPT Score in predicting the risk of bleeding. Methods: This was a retrospective study conducted in three hospitals in Kenya among patients on DAPT after ACS between January 2019 and April 2022. We reviewed medical records for demographic and clinical characteristics and conducted telephone interviews to assess bleeding for patients on DAPT for a minimum period of one year. Bleeding events were categorized according to the TIMI criteria for bleeding, and the PRECISE-DAPT Score was calculated using an online calculator. The cumulative one-year incidence of bleeding was calculated and presented as frequencies and percentages. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and C-statistics were used to quantify the ability of the PRECISE-DAPT Score to predict bleeding events, whereas calibration was estimated using the Hosmer‒Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Results: A total of 202 patients were enrolled in the study. The study population was predominantly male (n = 156, 77.2%) and African (n = 141, 69.8%), with a median age of 61 years (IQR 52–72). Majority were admitted with ST-Elevation Myocardial infarction (STEMI) (n = 126, 62.4%) and had a mildly reduced left ventricle ejection fraction (n = 124, 61.4%). Fourteen patients (6.9%) met the TIMI criteria for bleeding, of whom 11 (5.4%) had minimal bleeding and 3 (1.5%) had minor bleeding. There was no incidence of major bleeding. The discrimination and calibration of the PRECISE-DAPT Score was good {ROC curve 0.699 (95% CI: 0.564–0.835)} and the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (Chi-square, 6.53; p = 0.588), respectively.

It highlights how genetic factors underlying obesity exacerbate metabolic dysfunction through circadian misalignment and examines promising interventions to mitigate these effects. Recent Findings: Genome-wide association Studies (GWAS) have identified numerous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with obesity traits, attributing 40–75% heritability to body mass index (BMI). These findings illuminate critical links between genetic obesity, circadian clocks, and metabolic processes. SNPs in clock-related genes influence metabolic pathways, with disruptions in circadian rhythms—driven by poor sleep hygiene or erratic eating patterns—amplifying metabolic dysfunction. Circadian clocks, synchronized with the 24-h light–dark cycle, regulate key metabolic activities, including glucose metabolism, lipid storage, and energy utilization. Genetic mutations or external disruptions, such as irregular sleep or eating habits, can destabilize circadian rhythms, promoting weight gain and metabolic disorders. Summary: Circadian misalignment in individuals with genetic predispositions to obesity disrupts the release of key metabolic hormones, such as leptin and insulin, impairing hunger regulation and fat storage. Interventions like time-restricted feeding (TRF) and structured physical activity offer promising strategies to restore circadian harmony, improve metabolic health, and mitigate obesity-related risks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219624437

Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9), a member of the TGF-β superfamily, plays a key role in osteogenesis and tissue repair. However, its role in bone erosion and inflammation in RA remains underexplored. This study aims to evaluate BMP9’s therapeutic potential in RA, focusing on its effects on bone destruction, osteogenesis, and inflammation. Materials and methods: In this study, BMP9 expression was analyzed in synovial tissues from RA and osteoarthritis patients and in the ankle joints of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice using immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting. The therapeutic effect of BMP9 on bone destruction was evaluated in a CIA mouse model through micro-CT imaging, histological analysis, and clinical scoring. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed by alkaline phosphatase and Alizarin Red S staining, while osteoclast activity was examined through tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. Fluorescence double-labeling was used to track new bone formation. Data were analyzed using (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) SPSS, and appropriate statistical tests were performed to determine significance. Results: In this study, BMP9 expression was significantly down-regulated in the synovial tissue of RA patients and in the ankle joints of CIA mice. BMP9 treatment in CIA mice ameliorated joint inflammation, as shown by reduced limb swelling, lower arthritis index, and improved tissue morphology. Furthermore, BMP9 significantly alleviated bone loss, as evidenced by increased bone mineral density and trabecular structure. However, BMP9 treatment did not significantly impact osteoclastogenesis or bone resorption. BMP9 also enhanced bone mineralization and formation, as shown by increased mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate. Additionally, BMP9 promoted osteogenic differentiation of synovial cells, enhancing alkaline phosphatase activity and mineral nodule formation. These results suggest that BMP9 has a protective effect on joint inflammation and bone loss in RA, potentially through promoting bone formation without influencing osteoclast activity. Conclusion: Our study concludes that targeting BMP9 alleviates inflammation and promotes osteogenic differentiation in RA, highlighting BMP9 as a promising therapeutic target for addressing bone destruction in RA. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219622967

Decellularized tendon patch (DTP) was a biomimetic and effective material for reconstructing L-M RCTs. However, the protocol for DTP sterilization and storage is variable, which may influence their performance. The objective of this study is to optimize the protocol of DTP sterilization and storage and fabricate an off-the-shelf DTP with superior efficacy in enhancing the healing of L-M RCTs. Methods: DTPs were sterilized by ethylene oxide (EO) or gamma irradiation (GR), then preserved using cryo-preservation (CP) or freeze-drying (FD), thus preparing four kinds of DTPs (EO/CP-DTP, EO/FD-DTP, GR/CP-DTP, GR/FD-DTP). After evaluating their histology, microstructure, biomechanics, biocompatibility, and tenogenic inducibility in-vitro, a total of 88 male SD rats with chronic L-M RCTs were randomly divided into 4 groups, and then reconstructed with one of the four DTPs. At postoperative week 4 or 8, the supraspinatus tendon-to-humerus complexes were harvested for gross, micro-CT, histological, and mechanical evaluations. Results: In-vitro results indicated that the four kinds of DTPs showed excellent biocompatibility, and EO/CP-DTP showed an orderly collagen arrangement and higher tensile properties than the other DTPs. More importantly, the EO/CP-DTP can induce more interacted stem cells toward tenogenic lineages as compared with the other kinds of DTPs. Micro-CT showed that bony footprint in the four groups showed similar value in bone morphological parameters without significant difference. Histologically, the two CP-sterilized DTPs presented significantly higher scores than the FD-sterilized DTPs, while the EO/CP-DTP group exhibited slightly higher scores compared to the GR/CP-DTP group. As for the mechanical strength of the supraspinatus tendon-to-humerus complexes, a significantly higher failure load showed in the CP-sterilized DTPs when compared with the FD-sterilized DTPs at postoperative week 4 or 8. Conclusion: DTP should be sterilized by EO and preserved using CP, owing that this type of DTP well preserved the intrinsic bioactivity and mechanical properties as well as showed superior efficacy in enhancing the healing of L-M RCTs.

Hyperoxia and perinatal inflammation are main risk factors for preterm birth and associated brain injury. To date the majority of experimental studies have focused on isolated insults. However, clinically, WMI injury is a multifactorial disorder caused by a variety of triggers. To establish a clinically relevant rodent model of WMI, we combined prenatal inflammation with postnatal hyperoxia to investigate individual, and additive or synergistic effects on inflammatory processes, myelination and grey matter development. Methods: At embryonic day 20, pregnant Wistar rat dams received either a single intraperitoneal injection of 100 µg/ kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or sodium chloride. Offspring were either exposed to hyperoxia (80% O<inf>2</inf>) or normoxia (21% O<inf>2</inf>) from postnatal day 3 to 5. Animals were sacrificed immediately after hyperoxia or 6 days later, corresponding to term-equivalent age. White and grey matter development and neuroinflammatory responses were investigated at cellular and molecular levels applying immunohistochemistry, western blotting, real time PCR in brain tissues and multiplex protein expression analysis on serum samples. Results: Prenatal inflammation combined with postnatal hyperoxia resulted in reduced body weight and length in the offspring, accompanied by increased serum leptin levels at term equivalent age. The altered body parameters, like body weight, were associated with decreased brain volume, thinning of deep cortical layers and hypomyelination. As potential underlying mechanisms, we identified severe myelination deficits and an increased microglia activation associated with elevated inflammatory cytokine expression in brain tissues, while peripheral cytokine levels were reduced. Interestingly, effects on body size were mainly mediated by prenatal LPS, independent of hyperoxia, while oligodendrocyte degeneration was mainly induced by postnatal hyperoxia, independent of prenatal inflammation. However, for the majority of pathological changes, including brain size, myelination deficits, microglia activation and inflammatory cytokine expression, additive or synergistic effects were detected. Conclusion: Prenatal inflammation combined with postnatal hyperoxia results in aggravated myelination deficits and inflammatory responses compared to single insults, making it an ideal model to improve our understanding of the complex pathophysiology underlying WMI and to evaluate urgently needed therapies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219622106

In this context, ultrasound stands out as a valuable method. However, the absence of reference values complicates both the interpretation of the obtained parameters and the monitoring of their changes during nutritional interventions or training programs. Methods: A total of 6,270 ultrasound images obtained with a technique using a non-diagnostic B-mode 2.5 MHz ultrasound probe (BodyMetrixTM, IntelaMetrix, Inc., Livermore, CA, USA) were obtained from adult men and women and analysed by grouping them according to sex, body mass index (BMI), and age. The thicknesses of total (tSAT), superficial (sSAT), and deep (dSAT) subcutaneous adipose tissue and muscle (MT), their ratios (sSAT/dSAT and MT/SAT), and muscle echogenicity (EG) were measured at the abdomen, thigh, chest, triceps, and hip sites. Results: Women exhibited greater tSAT, sSAT, dSAT, and EG (p < 0.001) and lower MT (p < 0.001), sSAT/dSAT (p = 0.008 for the abdomen and p < 0.001 for the thigh), and MT/SAT (p < 0.001) compared to men at both the abdomen and thigh sites. SAT-related parameters showed significant correlations with BMI, with thicknesses correlating positively and ratios negatively (p < 0.001). Muscle-related parameters correlated significantly with age, with MT and EG showing positive correlations and MT/SAT showing negative correlations (p < 0.001) in both sexes. Among SAT parameters, dSAT showed the strongest association with BMI in both men and women. Conclusions: This study is the first to report the mean values of SAT-related quantitative and qualitative measurements (thickness and EG) in various body sites assessed through ultrasound and their associations with sex, BMI, and age in a large cohort. These findings could prove valuable in clinical practice for precise monitoring of nutritional and/or training interventions, as well as for a more comprehensive evaluation of nutritional status. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219621176

While studies highlight the role of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) in neonatal diseases and tumor hypoxia, their specific involvement in newborns experiencing fetal distress during delivery (FDNB) is not well understood. Here, we found elevated PMN-MDSC activation, increased glycolysis, enhanced lactate production, and upregulated HIF-1α expression in the blood of FDNB neonates compared to healthy newborns (NNB). Importantly, PMN-MDSC levels were inversely correlated with neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a marker for neurological injury. In neonatal mice subjected to acute hypoxia, a 48-h exposure led to a shift from exacerbation to amelioration of brain damage when compared with a 24-h period. This change was associated with a reduction in microglial activation, a decrease in the expression of inflammatory factors within the microglia, alongside increased peripheral PMN-MDSC activation. Depleting PMN-MDSCs led to heightened microglial activation and aggravated brain injury. Mechanistically, enhanced activation of PMN-MDSCs promotes HIF-1α accumulation while enhancing glycolysis and lactate release, thereby mitigating neonatal brain injury. Notably, lactate supplementation in hypoxic mice rescued brain damage caused by insufficient PMN-MDSC activation due to HIF-1α deficiency. Our study clarifies the role of lactate in peripheral PMN-MDSCs after acute hypoxia and its effects on microglial activation and subsequent brain injury. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219619899

Using a rodent tibialis anterior VML model, this study demonstrates microporous annealed particle (MAP) hydrogel scaffolds as a biomaterial platform for improved muscle regeneration. Unlike bulk (nanoporous) hydrogel scaffolds, MAP scaffolds enhance integration by preventing a foreign body reaction, slowing implant degradation, and promoting regenerative macrophage polarization. Cell migration and angiogenesis occur throughout the implant before MAP scaffold degradation, with muscle fibers and neuromuscular junctions forming within the scaffolds. These structures continue developing as the implant degrades, suggesting MAP hydrogel scaffolds offer a promising therapeutic approach for VML injuries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219619877

As current workflows are still time consuming and difficult to operate, CFD is not yet a standard tool in the clinical setting. There it could provide valuable information on aneurysm treatment, especially regarding local risks of rupture, which might help to optimize the individualized strategy of neurosurgical dissection during microsurgical aneurysm clipping. Method: We established and validated a semi-automated workflow using 3D rotational angiographies of 24 intracranial aneurysms from patients having received aneurysm treatment at our centre. Reconstruction of vessel geometry and generation of volume meshes was performed using AMIRA 6.2.0 and ICEM 17.1. For solving ANSYS CFX was used. For validational checks, tests regarding the volumetric impact of smoothing operations, the impact of mesh sizes on the results (grid convergence), geometric mesh quality and time tests for the time needed to perform the workflow were conducted in subgroups. Results: Most of the steps of the workflow were performed directly on the 3D images requiring no programming experience. The workflow led to final CFD results in a mean time of 22 min 51.4 s (95%-CI 20 min 51.562 s–24 min 51.238 s, n = 5). Volume of the geometries after pre-processing was in mean 4.46% higher than before in the analysed subgroup (95%-CI 3.43–5.50%). Regarding mesh sizes, mean relative aberrations of 2.30% (95%-CI 1.51–3.09%) were found for surface meshes and between 1.40% (95%-CI 1.07–1.72%) and 2.61% (95%-CI 1.93–3.29%) for volume meshes. Acceptable geometric mesh quality of volume meshes was found. Conclusions: We developed a semi-automated workflow for aneurysm CFD to benefit from hemodynamic data in the clinical setting. The ease of handling opens the workflow to clinicians untrained in programming. As previous studies have found that the distribution of hemodynamic parameters correlates with thin-walled aneurysm areas susceptible to rupture, these data might be beneficial for the operating neurosurgeon during aneurysm surgery, even in acute cases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219619833

Although rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons provide contact-mediated signals for the conversion of SCLCs into fate-committed SCs, the use of animal cells is clinically unacceptable. To overcome this problem, we previously acquired human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons (hiPSC-dSNs) as surrogates of rat DRG neurons that committed rat bone marrow SCLCs to the SC fate. In this study, we explored whether hiPSC-dSNs could mimic rat DRG neuron effects to obtain fate-committed SCs from hBMSC-derived SCLCs. Methods: hiPSCs were induced into hiPSC-dSNs using a specific chemical small molecule combination. hBMSCs were induced into hBMSC-derived SCLCs in a specific culture medium and then co-cultured with hiPSC-dSNs to generate SCs. The identity of hBMSC-derived SCs (hBMSC-dSCs) was examined by immunofluorescence, western bolt, electronic microscopy, and RNA-seq. Immunofluorescence was also used to detect the myelination capacity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neurite outgrowth analysis were used to test the secretion of neurotrophic factors. Results: The hBMSC-dSCs exhibited bi-/tri-polar morphology of SCs and maintained the expression of the SC markers S100, p75NTR, p0, GFAP, and Sox10, even after withdrawing the glia-inducing factors or hiPSC-dSNs. Electronic microscopy and RNA-seq analysis provided evidence that hBMSC-dSCs were similar to the original human SCs in terms of their function and a variety of characteristics. Furthermore, these cells formed MBP-positive segments and secreted neurotrophic factors to facilitate the neurite outgrowth of Neuro2A. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that phenotypically stable and functionally mature hBMSC-dSCs were generated efficiently via the co-culture of hiPSC-dSNs and hBMSC-derived SCLCs.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation holds promise as a treatment for CLTI; however, the harsh local environment poses challenges to its effectiveness. Apoptotic vesicles (ApoVs) are extracellular vesicles produced by cells undergoing apoptosis, and they can carry various biomolecules from their parent cells, including proteins, RNA, DNA, lipids, ions, and gas neurotransmitters. ApoVs play significant roles in anti-inflammatory responses, anti-tumor activities, and tissue regeneration through intercellular communication, and they have demonstrated potential as drug carriers. In this study, we investigated the potential of bone marrow stem cell (BMSC)-derived ApoVs for treating CLTI. Methods: In vivo, we explored the therapeutic effect of ApoVs on a hindlimb ischemia model through Laser Doppler, matrigel plug assay, and histological analysis. In vitro, we analyzed the effects of ApoVs on the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of HUVECs and explored the uptake process of ApoVs. In addition, Proteomic analysis, western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR, shRNA, and siRNA were used to analyze ApoVs-induced HUVECs activation and downstream signaling pathways. Results: BMSCs transplantation showed improvement in a hind limb ischemia model, and this effect still exists after apoptosis of BMSCs. Subsequently, ApoVs of BMSCs were isolated and found to improve mouse hind limb ischemia in vivo. In vitro, ApoVs can be ingested by HUVECs through dynamin-, clathrin-, and caveolin-mediated endocytosis and promote its proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, ApoVs transferred NAMPT to HUVECs, therefore activating the NAMPT/SIRT1/FOXO1 axis, influencing the transcriptional activity of FOXO1, and promoting angiogenesis. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the transplanted BMSCs can ameliorate hindlimb ischemia by releasing ApoVs during apoptosis. The main mechanism of this effect is promoting the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of HUVECs through the NAMPT/SIRT1/FOXO1 axis.

Using conditional gene knockout mouse models, we demonstrated that loss of Beclin 1 (Becn1), a major regulator of mammalian autophagy, exclusively in the megakaryocytic lineage disrupted autophagy in platelets but did not compromise megakaryopoiesis or the formation and function of platelets. Unexpectedly, conditional Becn1 deletion in male mice led to a remarkable increase in bone mass with improved bone quality, in association with a decrease in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and an increase in free testosterone (FT). In vivo Becn1 overexpression in megakaryocytic lineage-specific cells reduced bone mass and quality, along with an increase in SHBG and a decrease in FT. Transplantation of wild-type bone marrow cells into megakaryocytic lineage Becn1-deficient male mice restored bone mass and normalized SHBG and FT. Furthermore, bilateral orchiectomy of Becn1f/f;Pf4-iCre mice, which are crippled with the production of testosterone, resulted in a reduction in bone mass and quality, whereas in vivo overexpression of SHBG, specifically in the liver of Becn1f/f;Pf4-iCre mice, decreased FT and reduced bone mass and quality. In addition, metformin treatment, which induces SHBG expression, reduced FT and normalized bone mass in Becn1f/f;Pf4-iCre mice. We thus concluded that Becn1 of the megakaryocytic lineage is dispensable locally for platelet hemostasis but limits bone mass by increasing SHBG, which in turn reduces the FT of male mice. Our findings highlight a mechanism by which Becn1 from megakaryocytic lineage cells distally balances bone growth. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219611709

Cell-free exosome therapy holds great potential for wound healing. Dedifferentiated fat cells (DFATs) have been used in tissue engineering and regeneration, but there are no reports on the use of DFATs-derived exosomes in diabetic wound repair. Objectives: This study aims to investigate whether DFATs-Exos accelerated diabetic wound healing and explore its potential mechanism. Methods: In vitro, DFATs-Exos were harvested from adipose tissue and used to treat endothelial cells (ECs) and fibroblasts. XAV939 was used as a Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor. The biocompatibility of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel was assessed. In vivo, DFAT-derived exosomes were encapsulated in 10% GelMA hydrogel and applied to a diabetic wound model. Histological analysis and wound closure rates were evaluated. Results: DFATs-Exos promoted angiogenesis in ECs and significantly alleviated the high glucose-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and migration by activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In vivo, compared to DFAT-Exos or GelMA alone, the DFAT-Exos/GelMA combination accelerated wound closure and enhanced collagen maturity. Conclusion: The DFAT-Exos/GelMA hydrogel significantly promoted wound healing in a diabetic animal model through activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219610375

While preclinical studies have suggested the potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to repair and protect injured kidneys in AKI, clinical trials using transarterial MSCs transplantation have yielded disappointing results. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and safety of minimally invasive renal subcapsular transplantation of MSCs for treating AKI in a minipig model, ultimately aiming to facilitate the clinical translation of this approach. Methods: A novel AKI minipig model was established by combining cisplatin with hydration to evaluate the effectiveness of potential therapies. Renal subcapsular catheterization was successfully achieved under ultrasound guidance. Subsequently, the efficacy of renal subcapsular MSCs transplantation was assessed, and the biological role of the tryptophan metabolite kynurenine (Kyn) in AKI was elucidated through both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Results: The method of pre-hydration at 4% of body weight, followed by post-cisplatin (3.8 mg/kg) hydration at 2% of body weight, successfully established a cisplatin-induced AKI minipig model with a survival time exceeding 28 days, closely mimicking the clinical characteristics of typical AKI patients. Additionally, we discovered that multiple MSCs transplantations promoted renal function recovery more effectively than single transplantation via the renal subcapsular catheter. Furthermore, elevated levels of Kyn were observed in kidney during AKI, which activated the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated NF-κB/NLRP3/IL-1β signaling pathway in tubular epithelial cells, thereby exacerbating inflammatory injury. Conclusions: Ultrasound-guided renal subcapsular transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells is a safe and effective therapeutic approach for AKI, with the potential to bring about significant clinical advancements in the future. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219610344

The present observational study reports minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and substantial clinical benefit (SCB) values for several patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) used to monitor changes in joint pain and function following percutaneous treatment of knee OA with a combination of BMC and platelet products (n = 295 knees). Distribution-based approaches were used to determine 12-month MCID values for the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective, Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), Numeric Pain Scale (NPS), and modified Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) scores. Alternatively, a within-cohort, anchor-based approach, leveraging the modified SANE as a global transition question, was used to determine MCID values of 12.2, 8.4, and − 1.8, and SCB values of 29.5, 22.5, and − 3.0 for IKDC, LEFS, and NPS, respectively. Approximately 87% of treated knees reported change scores that met or exceeded an MCID value while 59% reported change scores that met or exceeded an SBC value for one or more PROMs. In reporting MCID and SCB values for PROMs following the treatment of knee OA with a combination of BMC and platelet products, we sought to provide a foundation for assessing the clinical efficacy of orthobiologic interventions in this developing field. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219610135

Fibroblasts are frequently employed in reprogramming studies due to their abundance and accessibility. However, they are also the key drivers in the progression of fibrosis, a pathological condition characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition and tissue scarring. Furthermore, the initial stage of reprogramming typically involves deactivating fibrotic pathways. Hence, direct reprogramming offers a valuable method to regenerate target cells for tissue repair while simultaneously reducing fibrotic tendencies. Understanding the link between reprogramming and fibrosis could help develop effective strategies to treat damaged tissue with a potential risk of fibrosis. This review summarizes the advances in direct reprogramming and reveals their anti-fibrosis effects in various organs such as the heart, liver, and skin. Furthermore, we dissect the mechanisms of reprogramming influenced by fibrotic molecules including TGF-β signaling, mechanical signaling, inflammation signaling, epigenetic modifiers, and metabolic regulators. Innovative methods for fibroblast reprogramming like small molecules, CRISPRa, modified mRNA, and the challenges of cellular heterogeneity and senescence faced by in vivo direct reprogramming, are also discussed. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219609773

Blood vessels provide the necessary oxygen and nutrients to nerve and bone tissues, and remove metabolic waste. Concomitantly, nerve fibers precede blood vessels during growth, promote vascularization, and influence bone cells by secreting neurotransmitters to stimulate osteogenesis. Despite the critical roles of both components, current biomaterials generally focus on enhancing intraosseous blood vessel repair, while often neglecting the contribution of nerves. Understanding the distribution and main functions of blood vessels and nerve fibers in bone is crucial for developing effective biomaterials for bone tissue engineering. This review first explores the anatomy of intraosseous blood vessels and nerve fibers, highlighting their vital roles in bone embryonic development, metabolism, and repair. It covers innovative bone regeneration strategies directed at accelerating the intrabony neurovascular system over the past 10 years. The issues covered included material properties (stiffness, surface topography, pore structures, conductivity, and piezoelectricity) and acellular biological factors [neurotrophins, peptides, ribonucleic acids (RNAs), inorganic ions, and exosomes]. Major challenges encountered by neurovascularized materials during their clinical translation have also been highlighted. Furthermore, the review discusses future research directions and potential developments aimed at producing bone repair materials that more accurately mimic the natural healing processes of bone tissue. This review will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and clinicians in developing novel neurovascularized biomaterials and accelerating their translation into clinical practice. By bridging the gap between experimental research and practical application, these advancements have the potential to transform the treatment of bone defects and significantly improve the quality of life for patients with bone-related conditions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219607832

As such, senescence induction is viewed as an efficacious countermeasure in cancer treatment. Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) has been reported to participate in tumor growth, metastasis and immunomodulation. However, the role of FEN1 in cellular senescence of breast cancer and its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Methods: In vitro assessments of breast cancer cell senescence and apoptosis were conducted using CCK-8 assay, cell cycle assay, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, and cleaved caspase-3 staining. Western blot, dihydroethidium (DHE) staining, RNA-sequencing, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), rescue experiments, and dual-luciferase reporter assay were performed to explore the potential target of FEN1. Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR assay, and immunostaining were used to evaluate the interaction between FEN1 and Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox transcription factor 1 (PBX1). A xenograft mouse model was employed to validate the effect of FEN1 on breast cancer cell senescence and apoptosis. Results: Functional analysis demonstrated that FEN1 suppressed both senescence and apoptosis of breast cancer cells in vitro, while in vivo experiments demonstrated moderate therapeutic effects. Further studies indicated that FEN1 deficiency promoted the aforementioned effects by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. RNA-sequencing and qRT-PCR assays revealed that FEN1 knockdown enhanced the expressions of several senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors and resulted in decreased PBX1 level. The rescue experiments by PBX1 overexpression verified that PBX1 mediated the senescence and apoptosis of breast cancer cells induced by FEN1 inhibition. In detail, FEN1 downregulation inhibited the transcription activity of PBX1, which was partially restored by itself overexpression. Of note, FEN1 directly interacted with PBX1. Furthermore, immunostaining illustrated the colocalization of FEN1 and PBX1 in breast cancer cells and tissues. In our local breast cancer cohort, a positive correlation was identified between the expression levels of FEN1 and PBX1. Conclusions: Knockdown of FEN1 facilitates breast cancer cell senescence through PBX1 down-regulation mediating increase in intracellular ROS levels. This study reveals FEN1 as a negative regulator of cellular senescence and provides support for pro-senescence cancer therapy. Given that FEN1 knockdown exhibited only moderate in vivo effects, these findings underscore the necessity of combining it with senolytic therapy to enhance therapeutic efficacy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219607540

Initially considered as a single cell type with defined characteristics, MSCs are now known as a heterogeneous cell population with remarkable differences in their properties. No consensus exists on how donor age affects MSC characteristics, like proliferation. Additionally, differences in differentiation capacities and immunophenotype could arise when MSCs are isolated from different animals breeds, which is relevant for experimental and preclinical studies of MSC-based treatments. Methods: In this study, we isolated bovine adipose tissue-derived MSCs from three age categories, i.e. fetal, calf, and adult, and of two different breeds, i.e. Holstein Friesian (HF) and Belgian Blue (BB). MSC characterization included tri-lineage differentiation, proliferation and senescence assays, and immunophenotyping using multi-color flow cytometry. Results: Especially fetal and calf HF-MSCs showed a high proliferation capacity, where 4 and 6 out of 7 donors, respectively, could surpass 30 population doublings. Adipogenic differentiation potential was higher for fetal and adult HF-MSCs. Furthermore, breed, but not age, affected their osteogenic differentiation potential, with BB-MSCs performing better. Evaluation of cell surface marker expression revealed a breed effect, as calf HF-MSCs showed a higher percentage of Cluster of Differentiation (CD)34+ cells compared to calf BB-MSCs, which was correlated with both osteogenic differentiation and proliferation potential. Conclusions: Our findings clearly show the impact of donor characteristics such as age and breed on MSC proliferation, immunophenotype, and differentiation potential, illustrating the importance of selecting the appropriate MSC donor for MSC-based treatments when allogeneic MSCs are considered. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219605498

Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) have been considered extremely promising for the treatment of SSc, and the biological effects of MSCs are partly attributed to the secretion of exosomes (exos). Our aim was to determine whether exosomes derived from AMSCs have parental biological effects to AMSCs in the therapy of SSc skin fibrosis. In vitro cellular experiments, AMSCs and SSc skin fibroblasts were cocultured in direct contact and transwell indirect contact at a ratio of 1:5 and 1:10, respectively, then exosomes were extracted from the cell culture supernatant of AMSCs and identified, and the exosomes were cocultured with fibroblasts to investigate the effects of AMSCs and exosomes on fibroblast collagen synthesis. Repeated subcutaneous injections of bleomycin (BLM) to construct a model of SSc skin fibrosis in vivo experiments, then AMSCs and exosomes were injected subcutaneously to investigate their effects on skin fibrosis in the BLM mice. The results revealed that exosomes had similar biological functions to AMSCs, by inhibiting the TGF-β1/Smad3 axis, which alleviated collagen synthesis in skin fibroblasts from SSc patients and skin fibrosis in BLM models. In conclusion, AMSCs-derived exosomes may be “rising star candidates” for the treatment of SSc skin fibrosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219595478

Generally speaking, GM play a role in human health mostly through metabolites. However, the causal relationship between GM, plasma metabolites, and OS remains unclear. Hence, in our study, we aim to clarify this relationship between GM, plasma metabolites, and OS, by employing a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. In this study, pooled data were derived from the public genome-wide association study (GWAS) in GM (GCST90032172 to GCST90032644), plasma metabolites (GCST90199621 to GCST90204603) and OS (finngen_R10_C3_OSTEOSARCOMA_EXALLC). The two-sample and two-step MR methods were used for the current analysis: (1) genetic causality between GM and plasma metabolites on OS; (2) mediation effects of plasma metabolites. For evaluating the previously described causal relationship, the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was primarily used, with complementary approaches including the weighted median, MR-Egger, weighted mode, and simple mode. Moreover, the MR-Egger intercept test and the mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) were employed to assess the horizontal multiplicity. The reliability of causality is verified by “leave-one-out” sensitivity analysis and the Cochran’s Q test for heterogeneity. The STROBE-MR checklist for the reporting of MR studies was used in this study. First, according to the IVW results, 13 types of GM, specifically, were identified to have a potential causal relationship with OS. After FDR correction, Phocea was defined as a strain with a clear causal relationship with OS (FDR-adjusted p < 0.05). Second, a total of 48 plasma metabolites were identified to have a potential causal relationship with OS, including 30 currently known metabolites, 7 metabolites not yet studied, and 11 metabolite ratios. Finally, we further explored whether plasma metabolites mediate the causal relationship between Phocea and OS. And as a result, two plasma metabolites, Eugenol sulfate levels (mediated proportion: 7.74% (14.2%, 1.3%)) and N-acetylphenylalanine levels (mediated proportion: 3.52% (6.18%, 0.867%)), that may mediate the causal link between Phocea and OS were identified. All of the above results were subjected to sensitivity analysis. The causal relationship between GM, plasma metabolites, and OS was revealed in this MR study. Importantly, this study also demonstrated the mediating role of plasma metabolites levels of Eugenol sulfate levels and N-acetylphenylalanine levels in modulating the causal relationship between Phocea and OS. Of course, further research needs to be conducted to verify the above findings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219588785

Patients with CD typically present with skeletal abnormalities and 75% of them have sex reversal. In this study, we use CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) model from a heathy male donor, based on a previously reported SOX9 splice site mutation in a CD patients. This hiPSCs-derived chondrocytes from heterozygotes (HT) and homozygotes (HM) SOX9 mutation carriers showed significant defects in chondrogenesis. Bulk RNA profiling revealed that the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway, ribosome-related, and chromosome segregation-related gene sets were altered in the HT chondrocytes. The profile also showed significant noggin upregulation in CD chondrocytes, with ChIP-qPCR confirming that SOX9 binds to the distal regulatory element of noggin. This suggests SOX9 plays a feedback role in the BMP signaling pathway by modulating noggin expression rather than acting solely as a downstream regulator. This provides further insights into its dosage sensitivity in chondrogenesis. Overexpression of SOX9 showed promising results with improved sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) aggregation and COL2A1 expression following differentiation. We hope this finding could provide a better understanding of the dosage-dependent role of SOX9 in chondrogenesis and contribute to the development of improved therapeutic targets for CD patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219587977

In this study, we demonstrate that PCOS mouse serum-derived EXOs promote granulosa cells (GCs) ferroptosis, and induce the occurrence of a PCOS-like phenotype in vivo. Notably, EXO miRNA sequencing combined with in vitro gain- and loss-of-function assays revealed that miR-128-3p, which is absent in the serum-derived EXOs of mice with PCOS, regulates lipid peroxidation and GC sensitivity to ferroptosis inducers. Mechanistically, overexpression of CSF1, a direct target of miR-128-3p, reversed the anti-ferroptotic effect of miR-128-3p. Conversely, ferroptosis induction was mitigated in CSF1-downregulated GCs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-128-3p inhibition activates the p38/JNK pathway via CSF1, leading to NRF2-mediated down-regulation of SLC7A11 transcription, which triggers GC iron overload. Moreover, intrathecal miR-128-3p AgomiR injection into mouse ovaries ameliorated PCOS-like characteristics and restored fertility in letrozole-induced mice. The study reveals the pathological mechanisms of PCOS based on circulating EXOs and provides the first evidence of the roles of miR-128-3p and CSF1 in ovarian GCs. This discovery is expected to provide promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of PCOS.

Nevertheless, its clinical application is constrained by its impact on healthy tissues and various organ systems. Specifically, it can compromise kidney function, resulting in toxicological concerns. Studies have demonstrated that vincristine contributes to nephrotoxicity via the induction of oxidative stress. Objectives: The present research focused on assessing the influence of mitochondrial transplantation in mitigating the mitochondrial and cellular toxicity associated with VCR in renal proximal tubular cells (RPTCs). Methods: This investigation evaluated specific toxicity metrics, including cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), glutathione (GSH) concentration, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. Freshly prepared active mitochondria were obtained from the kidneys of Wistar rats. Results: The data demonstrated the cytotoxic effects of VCR on RPTCs. It was further observed that vincristine triggered oxidative stress, characterized by heightened ROS levels, diminished GSH content, decreased SDH activity, and increased lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, VCR caused notable damage to both mitochondrial and lysosomal membranes, along with a significant decrease in ATP content. The innovative strategy of mitochondrial transplantation mitigated oxidative stress, alleviated mitochondrial membrane damage, and prevented ROS-mediated apoptosis signaling induced by vincristine in RPTCs. Our results also indicated an increase in ATP levels within these cells. Conclusions: Our investigation suggests that the proposed treatment modality may prove beneficial in addressing drug-induced nephrotoxicity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219494439

The present study reports larval, pupal, and adult development period, survival rate, parameters of life table, and nutritional indices of S. frugiperda on maize-artificial diet (maize up to 3rd instar and artificial diet after), artificial diet, maize leaves, and castor leaves under laboratory conditions. Egg to adult preoviposition development time on maize-artificial diet (27.78 ± 0.31 days) was significantly lower than that on other diets. Furthermore, S. frugiperda fecundity on maize-artificial diet was significantly higher than on artificial diet, maize leaves, and castor leaves. The values of finite rate of increase (λ) and intrinsic rate of increase (r) were highest on the maize-artificial diet at 0.176 day−1 and 1.193 day−1, respectively, as compared to others. The values of nutritional indices such as relative growth rate (RGR) and relative consumption rate (RCR) were substantially superior for S. frugiperda fed on maize-artificial diet, artificial diet, and maize leaves than for larvae fed on castor leaves. Growth and reproduction parameters values showed that S. frugiperda larvae rearing on successive feeding on maize-artificial diet were the most suitable. The present study concludes that maize-artificial diet–based successive feeding can be used as mass multiplication of S. frugiperda in laboratory conditions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219240478

This study investigates the involvement of SYNPO2 in neuronal autophagy and explores the potential of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to alleviate HIE-induced dysfunction by inhibiting SYNPO2-mediated autophagy. Using in vitro and in vivo neonatal HIE models, we observed an upregulation of SYNPO2 expression, accompanied by increased neuronal injury and aggregation of autophagy-related proteins. Intervention with BMSCs effectively reduced SYNPO2 expression, and SYNPO2 depression mitigated neuroautophagic damage and improved neurological dysfunctions. Moreover, SYNPO2 overexpression exacerbated neuroautophagy despite BMSC treatment, while SYNPO2 depletion notably reduced neuroautophagic damage and alleviated cognitive impairments, retaining the neuroprotective efficacy of BMSC treatment.

MAPK7 (Mitogen-activated protein kinase 7), a member of MAPK family, controls cell differentiation, proliferation and survival. However, the specific role of Mapk7 in regulating osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs remains to be determined. In this study, depletion of Mapk7 in MSCs by crossing Prx1-Cre mice to Mapk7flox/flox resulted in severe low bone mass and accumulation of fat in bone marrow exhibiting osteoporosis (OP) in mice. Mapk7 promoted osteogenic differentiation and inhibited adipogenic differentiation of MSCs after knocking out and over-expressing Mapk7 in vitro. Mechanistically, Mapk7 activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling by phosphorylating Lrp6 at Ser1490, which ultimately enhanced osteogenesis and suppressed adipogenesis of MSCs. This is of great clinical and scientific significance for understanding biological function of Mapk7 and developing potential therapeutic targets for treatment of MSCs differentiation imbalance related bone diseases, such as, osteoporosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219210526

The primary focus is on how these composites influence macrophage reprogramming and neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation by modulating Slamf9 expression. MSC-derived EVs were successfully isolated, and DSCM hydrogels were prepared from porcine spinal cords. The composite material, EVs derived from MSCs (DSCM@EVs), was constructed and applied to a mouse SCI model, showing significant enhancement in NSC differentiation and axonal growth, thereby alleviating SCI. Bioinformatics and in vitro cell experiments revealed that DSCM@EVs promote the reprogramming of M1 macrophages to the M2 phenotype, reducing inflammatory responses and facilitating NSC differentiation. RNA-seq analysis identified Slamf9 as a key regulatory gene, with its suppression linked to the observed therapeutic effects. This novel approach demonstrates the potential of DSCM@EVs in SCI repair by modulating the inflammatory environment and promoting neural regeneration, offering a promising strategy for treating SCI and potentially other inflammatory neurological disorders. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219207185

However, the pharmacological mechanisms through which NAR prevents and treats intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) remain unclear. We utilized bioinformatics, machine learning, and network pharmacology to identify shared targets among NAR, senescence, and IDD. Subsequently, molecular docking was conducted to evaluate NAR’s binding affinity to common target. Additionally, we used IL-1β to induce senescence and degeneration in nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) and conducted a series of cellular assays, including immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, β-galactosidase staining, cell proliferation, cell cycle analysis, and measurement of reactive oxygen species levels, to investigate NAR’s impact on IL-1β-induced senescence and degeneration of NPCs. Our study revealed that Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) was the only common target. IGFBP3 exhibited significant differences between the IDD and healthy groups and proved to be an effective diagnostic marker for IDD. Molecular docking confirmed the binding between NAR and IGFBP3. In vitro experiments, we observed that Igfbp3 expression increased in the senescence and degeneration groups. Igfbp3 knockdown and NAR attenuated IL-1β-induced senescence and degenerative phenotypes in NPCs. In contrast, the effect of NAR was attenuated by recombinant IGFBP3 protein. In conclusion, our findings suggest that NAR plays a preventive and therapeutic role in IDD, likely achieved through the inhibition of Igfbp3 expression. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219196743

A total of sixty patients diagnosed with DFUs were randomly assigned to either the NPWT group (n = 40) or the Non-NPWT group (n = 20) in a 2:1 ratio. After debridement, the NPWT group received NPWT treatment for one week, while the Non-NPWT group underwent routine dressing therapy. The expression of miR-155 in DFU granulation tissues was evaluated by qRT-PCR before and after treatment for one week. Following termination, wound healing rates were assessed in the NPWT group, and the correlation between variations in miR-155 expression (ΔmiR-155) and wound healing was analyzed pre and post NPWT treatment. In vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of negative pressure on variations of miR-155 expression, as well as proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). The NPWT group showed a decrease in miR-155 expression in wound granulation tissue compared with pre-treatment [4.12 (1.22, 14.85) vs. 6.83 (2.15, 15.72), P < 0.05]. Conversely, there was no statistically significant difference in miR-155 expression in wound granulation tissue between pre-treatment and post-treatment in the Non-NPWT group (P > 0.05). However, analysis revealed a positive correlation between ΔmiR-155 and wound healing rate after 4 weeks in the NPWT group (χ2 = 4.829, P = 0.028). The in vitro experiments showed a significant decrease in miR-155 expression in NHDFs under negative pressure measured at -125 mmHg (P < 0.05). This reduction in miR-155 expression, in turn, enhanced the proliferation and migration ability while decreasing the apoptosis rate of NHDFs by targeting the upregulation of fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) gene expression (P < 0.05). It is concluded that NPWT promotes DFU healing by reducing the expression of miR-155 in granulation tissue and the efficacy of NPWT correlated with altered miR-155 expression in wound tissue. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219178270

However, a thorough understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving LFH fibrotic progression remains incomplete. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to construct the single-cell map of human ligamentum flavum (LF) samples. An integrated multi-omics approach, encompassing scRNA-seq, bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq), and Mendelian randomization (MR), was applied to conduct comprehensive functional analysis. Clinical tissue specimens and animal models were employed to further confirm the multi-omics findings. Results: ScRNA-seq provided a single-cell level view of the fibrotic microenvironment in LF, revealing significantly increased proportions of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and macrophages in LFH. Using transmission electron microscopy, single-cell gene set scoring, and MR analysis, ferroptosis was identified as a critical risk factor and pathway within LFH. Subcluster analysis of fibroblasts revealed functional heterogeneity among distinct subpopulations, highlighting the functional characteristics and the metabolic dynamics of fibroblast with a high ferroptosis score (High Ferro-score FB). The quantification of gene expression at single-cell level revealed that ferroptosis increased along with fibrosis in LFH specimens, a finding further validated in both human and mice tissue sections. Consistently, bulk RNA-seq confirmed increased proportions of fibroblasts and macrophages in LFH specimens, underscoring a strong correlation between these cell types through Spearman correlation analysis. Notably, subcluster analysis of the mononuclear phagocytes identified a specific subset of SPP1+ macrophages (SPP1+ Mac) enriched in LFH, which exhibited activation of fibrosis and ferroptosis-related metabolic pathways. Cell-cell communication analysis highlighted that SPP1+ Mac exhibited the strongest outgoing and incoming interactions among mononuclear phagocytes in the LFH microenvironment. Ligand-receptor analysis further revealed that the SPP1-CD44 axis could serve as a key mediator regulating the activity of High Ferro-score FB. Multiplex immunofluorescence confirmed substantial Collagen I deposition and reduced Ferritin Light Chain expression in regions with SPP1-CD44 co-localization in LFH specimens. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that SPP1+ Mac may contribute to LFH fibrosis by regulating ferroptosis in High Ferro-score FB through the SPP1-CD44 axis. This study enhances our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying LFH progression, potentially improving early diagnostic strategies and identifying new therapeutic targets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219167269

The convenience of the new instruments was evaluated by comparing evaluation indicators. The multi-functional instruments reduced the number of fluoroscopy, shorted the operation time, improved the delivery efficiency, reduced the intraoperative blood loss, and reduced the surgical incision compared with the traditional method (p < 0.05).

Comparative proteome analysis was performed for LR muscle cells at different passages (1, 15 and 25) using label free quantitative proteomics. A total of 138 proteins containing ≥ two unique peptides were used to assess expression at the different passages. Hierarchical clustering of the top 25 proteins with significant differences in abundances was plotted across the different passages with a fold-change of 1.5. Protein–protein interactions of significantly expressed proteins with respective KEGG pathways were represented using STRING. The metascape depicts the network of significantly enriched proteins with functional annotation of protein-encoding genes. Functional analysis of differentially expressed proteins was marked as glycolytic (eno1 and eno3), metabolic (pgm, smyd1, ak1, aldob and bpgm), cytoplasmic ribosomal (rpl27, rpl3 and eifa5) and carbon metabolic (pdh) pathways across the three passages. The expression of ribosomal proteins like eif5a, rps8a, rpl30, rpl27, rpl3 in the LR muscle cells participates in muscle growth and maintenance by altering translational capacity of the cells. Cytoskeletal proteins such as annexin and tropomyosin are involved in the adhesion and reorganization of cytoskeleton signaling during early differentiation of LR muscle cells. The proteins observed across the pathways were also correlated with the differentiation of LR muscle cells during myogenesis.

Current therapies are limited to symptom management, unable to prevent neuronal loss or halt the progression of the disease. A significant limitation to more effective treatments is the difficulty of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) communication plays a crucial role in several physiological processes within the nervous system. Notably, EVs have the unique ability to cross the BBB, making them a highly promising vehicle for delivering therapeutic agents directly to the brain. Given the rising prevalence of PD, the need for therapies that prevent neuronal death and promote cell survival is urgent. This study explores the potential of neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (NSC-EVs) using two in vitro models of PD. Our findings demonstrate that NSC-EVs significantly enhance the survival of dopaminergic neurons by reducing apoptosis and showing strong neuroprotective effects. Notably, the natural extracellular vesicles used in this study are enriched with Catalase, a potent scavenger protein with antioxidant properties. This natural enrichment further strengthens their neuroprotective capacity, enabling them to mitigate oxidative stress and protect vulnerable neurons. The use of such naturally enriched extracellular vesicles represents a promising approach for developing innovative therapies to effectively combat Parkinson’s disease. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219147459

However, its involvement in H/R-induced pyroptosis remains unclear. Methods: The H/R exposed rat cardiomyocyte H9c2 was utilized as in vitro model, and the expression levels of miR-155-5p and SIRT1 in cells were modulated through cell transfection experiments. Cell proliferative activity was assessed using the Cell counting kit-8 assay. Supernatant lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was determined through colorimetry. The levels of living and dead cell were observed via Calcin-AM/PI staining. Levels of supernatant interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 were measured using ELISA assay.

The protein expression levels of SIRT1, NLRP3, N-terminal gasdermin D (GSDMD-N), and Cleaved caspase-1 were evaluated using Western blot analysis. The targeted regulatory relationship between miR-155-5p and SIRT1 was verified using dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Results: The proliferation activity of H9c2 cells induced by H/R was attenuated, accompanied by severe injury, increased cell death, and the release of a substantial amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. In addition, H/R stimulation resulted in the upregulation of miR-155-5p expression and downregulation of SIRT1 expression in H9c2 cells. Suppression of miR-155-5p or overexpression of SIRT1 exhibited ameliorative effects on H/R-induced cellular injury in H9c2 cells and inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. The dual-luciferase assay confirmed the direct targeting of SIRT1 by miR-155-5p in H9c2 cells. Furthermore, partial reversal of the inhibitory effect of miR-155-5p inhibitor on H/R-induced NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis in H9c2 cells was observed upon interference with SIRT1 expression. Conclusion: Inhibition of miR-155-5p alleviates cardiomyocyte pyroptosis induced by H/R via targeting SIRT1-mediated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219144831

However, studies investigating the relationship between metal exposure and bone health conditions such as osteopenia and osteoporosis have either produced inconsistent results or are scarce, especially among the ethnic minorities in China. Herein, we correlated single-metal and metal mixture exposure with osteopenia and osteoporosis using a log-binomial regression model and quantile g-computation. In total, 9,206 ethnic Chinese individuals (Dong and Miao) aged 30–79 years were investigated in this study utilizing the baseline data from the Chinese multi-ethnic cohort study. In the single-metal exposure model, urinary concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), iron(Fe), mercury(Hg), and manganese (Mn) were positively associated with of osteopenia, whereas those of cobalt(Co) and zinc(Zn) concentrations were negatively associated. Additionally, urinary As, Cd, Cr, and Mn concentrations were positively associated with osteoporosis, whereas that of vanadium(V) was negatively associated. Furthermore, Quantile g-computation results indicated that metal mixture exposure was positively associated with both osteopenia and osteoporosis. Altogether, these findings suggest that simultaneous exposure to multiple metals can affect bone health, providing a theoretical basis for further studies on underlying complex mechanisms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219080255

As a significant cause of circadian disruption, shift work is closely associated with an increased risk for periodontitis. Nevertheless, how shift work-related circadian disruption functions in periodontitis remains unknown. Herein, we employed a simulated shift work model constructed by controlling the environmental light-dark cycles and revealed that shift work-related circadian disruption exacerbated the progression of experimental periodontitis. RNA sequencing and in vitro experiments indicated that downregulation of the core circadian protein brain and muscle ARNT-like protein 1 (BMAL1) and activation of the Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis were involved in the pathogenesis of that. Mechanically, BMAL1 regulated GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis by suppressing NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome signaling through modulating nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1 (NR1D1), and inhibiting Gsdmd transcription via directly binding to the E-box elements in its promoter. GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis accelerated periodontitis progression, whereas downregulated BMAL1 under circadian disruption further aggravated periodontal destruction by increasing GSDMD activity. And restoring the level of BMAL1 by circadian recovery and SR8278 injection alleviated simulated shift work-exacerbated periodontitis via lessening GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis. These findings provide new evidence and potential interventional targets for circadian disruption-accelerated periodontitis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219056135

The common finding of bilateral symmetric joint involvement may suggest influence from systemic factors, and could imply that body parameters such as excess body fat and cat size are important for OA development. We aimed to investigate associations between body composition and whole-body OA scores in 72 cats, using whole-body computed tomography (CT), and if serum concentrations of the metabolic mediators leptin, adiponectin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) reflected the total OA load. In addition, associations between body composition and metabolic mediators were determined. For data analyses, cats were grouped as smaller or larger according to the median value of the total body bone volume (body size), and as leaner or fatter cats according to the median of the total body fat volumes normalized for body size (nBFV). Results: Computed tomography-detected OA changes were present in 94% of cats. In appendicular joints, OA was most commonly detected in hip joints followed by elbow, stifle, carpal, tarsal and shoulder joints, whereas in axial joints, OA was most commonly detected in the thoracic region. Groupwise comparisons showed that whole-body OA scores were higher for fatter compared to leaner cats (p = 0.012), and larger fatter cats had higher whole-body OA scores compared to smaller leaner cats (p = 0.021). Whole-body OA scores were associated with IGF-1 concentrations (p = 0.0051). Leptin concentrations were strongly associated with nBFV (p < 0.0001), whereas IGF-1 concentrations were weakly associated with total body bone volumes (p = 0.0134). Individual joint region OA scores were higher in carpal, elbow, stifle and hip joints in fatter cats, in carpal joints in larger and larger fatter cats, in elbow joints in larger leaner cats, and in stifle joints in smaller fatter cats. Conclusions: In cats, increased body fat is a risk factor for having a higher load of OA, particularly in carpal, elbow, stifle and hip joints. Increased body size is additionally a risk factor for having carpal OA. The total OA load is reflected in serum IGF-1 concentrations, but underlying mechanisms for this association are unclear. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85219000763

Phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) plays essential roles in regulating the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, whether PDE4B or NLRP3 is involved in the development of IDD is unclear. This study sought to explore the role of PDE4B in IDD pathogenesis by in vivo and in vitro experiments. This results showed that PDE4B and NLRP3 were significantly upregulated in nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues from IDD-related human patients. Deletion of PDE4B in the NP resulted in downregulated JNK and NLRP3. Aberrant PDE4B expression enhanced the phosphorylation of JNK and NLRP3 expression. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the pde4b gene delayed IDD pathogenesis, and PDE4 inhibitor also can reverse the IDD pathogenesis. Our study showed that aberrant PDE4B activation in NP tissues induces pathological changes in IDD, phosphorylation of JNK and NLRP3 are involved in this process, and inhibition of aberrant PDE4B activity is a potential therapeutic strategy for IDD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218962559

UL82 is a tegument protein of HCMV, and our previous research indicated that the presence of UL82 is significantly associated with reduced overall survival in CRC patients. However, the mechanism by which UL82 affects the prognosis of CRC patients remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of UL82 in CRC progression through both in vitro and in vivo experiments, and revealed its downstream regulatory pathways by integrating transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics. Our findings first revealed that UL82 significantly promoted CRC cell proliferation by increasing the proportion of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, UL82 enhanced the expression of the oncogene AGR2, while knockdown of AGR2 abolished the proliferative effect of UL82. Interestingly, UL82 interacted with the transcription factor DDX5, which transcriptionally inhibited AGR2 expression. Furthermore, this UL82-AGR2 axis promoted nucleotide metabolism in CRC cells by enhancing the levels of nucleotide synthesis enzymes DTYMK, RRM2, and TYMS. In conclusion, our study suggests that the UL82/DDX5 complex may promote nucleotide metabolism and cell cycle progression of CRC by upregulating AGR2 and UL82 may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker for CRC patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218955354

The ultimate goal of this study was to predict histological scores, the gold standard parameter in osteoarthritis (OA), based on locomotor or structural deficits. Methods: The CIOA model was induced in C57BL/6 male mice, which were then maintained in their home cage with or without a running wheel for 6 weeks. Both global and fine locomotor effects were measured using the open field and Catwalk™ tests. Imaging of bone and cartilage was performed using either µCT, contrast-enhanced µCT or confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) at different time points. Correlations between functional or structural changes and histological scores were sought in order to provide tools for predicting histological degradation. Results: Locomotor deficits were observed at early time points (days 3 to 9) but did not persist to the end of the experiment. Signs of inflammation appeared as early as day 9. They worsened on day 28 as the disease progressed and meniscal calcifications were observed by µCT. The early functional and structural changes correlated with the histological scores measured post mortem and some specific locomotor or structural parameters were identified as predictors of histological changes. Free exercise (voluntary running wheel activity) did not seem to influence the severity of the observed changes. Conclusions: Open-field quantification of kinetic parameters is a simple and timely relevant test to detect early locomotor changes and predict histological changes. Meniscal calcifications and osteophyte formation, which can be observed by µCT at early time points, are also highly predictive of OA severity. These two non-invasive techniques are very useful for longitudinal monitoring of mice and OA score prediction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218912089

Shuanghe Decoction (SHD), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, has shown significant efficacy in treating SONFH, though its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Purpose: This study aims to elucidate the therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of SHD on SONFH through in vivo experiments, combined with network pharmacology, metabolomics, and gut microbiota analysis. Materials and methods: Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats (300 ± 20 g) were randomly assigned to four groups: Control, Model, SHD-L, and SHD-H, with 10 rats each. SONFH was induced in all groups except the Control group using lipopolysaccharide and methylprednisolone. The SHD-L and SHD-H groups were treated with Shuanghe decoction at doses of 4.86 g/kg/day and 9.72 g/kg/day, respectively, for eight weeks. Bone morphology, pathological changes, and osteogenic factors were evaluated using Micro-CT, histological staining, and immunohistochemistry. Network pharmacology, metabolomics, and gut microbiota analyses were conducted to explore SHD’s mechanisms. Results: SHD improved bone morphology and increased osteogenic factor expression (RUNX2, OCN, COL-I). Network pharmacology indicated that metabolic pathways play a key role in SHD’s therapeutic effects. Metabolomic analysis identified 14 differential metabolites, including 21-hydroxypregnenolone and tyramine, which were restored to normal levels by SHD. Gut microbiota analysis revealed that SHD modulated bacterial abundance, particularly Verrucomicrobia, Allobaculum, and Burkholderiales. A comprehensive network identified two key metabolites (tyramine, 21-hydroxypregnenolone), seven targets (CYP19A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, MIF, and HSD11B1), two metabolic pathways (tyrosine metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis), and four bacterial taxa (Jeotgalicoccus, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, rc4-4) as central to SHD against SONFH. Conclusion: SHD alleviates SONFH by reshaping gut microbiota, reversing metabolic imbalances, and enhancing osteogenesis. Our findings provide novel insights into the pharmacological mechanisms of SHD, laying a foundation for its clinical application in treating SONFH. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218909810

However, both endogenous and transplanted NP-MSCs demonstrate limited proliferative capacity, increased apoptosis, and reduced resilience to the harsh microenvironment within the degenerative intervertebral disc (IVD). Methods: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was utilized to identify genes and associated mechanisms that mediate the responses of NP-MSCs to acidic conditions. Western blotting, qPCR, and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) expression in NP-MSCs. Apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) anabolism were assessed via flow cytometry, TUNEL staining and Western blotting, while the TGF-β/Smad2/3 pathway was analyzed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence. FSTL1 knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA) was performed to determine its role in apoptosis and ECM regulation. The FSTL1 siRNA pretreatment was assessed in a puncture-induced rat IVDD model using MRI and histological staining. Results: Using RNA-seq, we identified FSTL1 as the primary acid-responsive gene in NP-MSCs. We further observed elevated FSTL1 expression in NP-MSCs isolated from degenerative IVDs in both humans and rats compared to normal IVDs. Acidic conditions upregulated FSTL1 expression in NP-MSCs in a pH-dependent manner. Notably, recombinant FSTL1 was shown to enhance cellular apoptosis and disrupt ECM metabolism. Conversely, silencing FSTL1 with siRNA reduced NP-MSC apoptosis and improved ECM anabolism. Importantly, TGF-β pathway inhibition partially reversed the pro-apoptotic and ECM catabolism effects of FSTL1. In the rat model of IVDD, pretreatment of NP-MSCs with FSTL1 siRNA significantly suppressed IVDD progression.

Therefore, this study compared supernatants of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) with umbilical cord wharton’s jelly’s mesenchymal stem cells (UC-WJ MSCs) in different states (non-senescent and replicative senescence) on the MM cells. Methods: We extracted human BM-MSCs and UC-WJ MSCs in vitro and used H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> to induce replicative senescence. Concentrated supernatants from MSCs and senescent MSCs (SMSCs) were added to MM cells. Cell proliferation, the cell cycle, apoptosis, cell migration, tumor stemness factor expression, and cytokine expression levels were analyzed. Transcription regulation of signaling pathways was discussed. Results: We successfully isolated and identified BM-MSCs, UC-WJ MSCs, and SMSCs. When concentrated supernatants from BM-MSCs, UC-WJ MSCs, senescent BM-MSCs (SBM-MSCs), senescent UCWJ MSCs (SUC-WJ MSCs) were used to treat MM cells, BMMSCs and SBM-MSCs supernatants promoted the proliferation of MM cells, with a more pronounced effect by SBM-MSCs. UC-WJ MSCs and SUC-WJ MSCs supernatants inhibited the viability and proliferation of MM cells. BM-MSCs and SBM-MSCs supernatants increased the proportion of MM cells in the S-phase, with the effect of SBM-MSCs being more evident. UC-WJ MSCs and SUC-WJ MSCs supernatants arrested MM cells in the G0/G1 phase. BM-MSCs and SBM-MSCs supernatants enhanced the migration and tumor stemness of MM cells, with SBMMSCs having a more dramatic effect. UC-WJ MSCs and SUC-WJ MSCs supernatants inhibited the migration and tumor stemness of MM cells, with UC-WJ MSCs having a more inhibitory effect. IL-6 and VEGFA expression correlated negatively with the survival of patients with MM according to online database analysis, in addition, we found that the expression of IL-6 and VEGFA was higher in MM patients through GEO database analysis. BM-MSCs and SBM-MSCs supernatants treatment increased the expression of IL-6 and VEGFA on MM cells, while UC-WJ MSCs and SUC-WJ MSCs supernatants inhibited their expression. Signal pathway validation showed that the biological function of MSCs in MM is closely related to the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway. Conclusion: The supernatants of BM-MSCs promote the proliferation of MM cells, On the contrary, the supernatants of UC-WJ MSCs inhibit MM cell proliferation. We observed that MSCs from different sources and different states have contrasting biological functions in MM cells. Furthermore, this research was provided to the optimal cancer gene therapy vector for MM was UC-WJ MSCs, even UC-WJ MSCs was in the state of senescence. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218878511

This study aimed to investigate the role and potential mechanisms of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) overexpressing acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) in diabetic wound healing in a rat model. Methods: ADSCs were genetically modified to achieve stable overexpression of aFGF. Varying doses of aFGF-ADSCs (1 × 106, 2 × 106, 3 × 106, 4 × 106) were injected into the muscular tissue surrounding diabetic rat wounds. We assessed aFGF expression and its impact on various stages of wound healing, including angiogenesis, inflammatory response, epithelialization, and collagen deposition. Transcriptomic sequencing was performed to explore the underlying mechanisms driving enhanced wound healing. Results: Lentiviral transduction successfully induced stable aFGF overexpression in ADSCs. In vivo experiments revealed that varying doses of aFGF-ADSCs markedly enhanced wound healing in diabetic rats in a dose-dependent manner. The dose of 3 × 10⁶ aFGF-ADSCs demonstrated the most significant effect. In the 3 × 106 aFGF-ADSCs group, expression levels of aFGF, CD31, and CD163 were significantly higher than in other groups (p < 0.05), while CD86 expression was significantly lower (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Single doses of aFGF-ADSCs comprehensively improved various aspects of wound repair in diabetic rats, offering a potential new approach for treating chronic diabetic wounds. The mechanism of action involves promoting angiogenesis, modulating inflammatory responses, accelerating epithelialization, and optimizing collagen deposition. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218857295

This study aimed to evaluate the extended safety and efficacy of MSC treatment in severe patients with COVID-19 who participated in our earlier randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with follow-up conducted over 3 years. Methods: One hundred patients with severe COVID-19 were randomized to receive either an MSC infusion (n = 65, 4 × 107 cells/dose, on days 0, 3, and 6) or a placebo, with both groups receiving the standard of care. At 36 months post-MSC therapy, patients were followed up to long-term safety and efficacy, particularly the effects of MSC therapy on persistent COVID-19 symptoms. Evaluated outcomes included lung imaging results, 6-min walking distance (6-MWD), pulmonary function test results, quality of life scores based on the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey, Long COVID symptoms, new-onset comorbidities, tumor marker levels, and rates of COVID-19 reinfection. Results: Three years post-treatment, 46.94% (23/49) of patients in the MSC group and 34.48% (10/29) in the placebo group showed normal findings on computed tomography (CT) images (odds ratio [OR] = 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65–4.34). The general health (GH) score from the SF-36 was higher in the MSC group (67.0) compared to the placebo group (50.0), with a difference of 12.86 (95% CI: 1.44–24.28). Both groups showed similar results for total lung severity scores (TSS), 6-MWD, pulmonary function tests, and Long COVID symptoms. No significant differences between groups were observed in new-onset complications (including tumorigenesis) or tumor marker levels. After adjusting for China’s dynamic zero-COVID-19 strategy, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection rates were 53.06% (26/49) in the MSC group and 67.86% (19/28) in the placebo group (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.20–1.41). Conclusions: These findings support the long-term safety of MSC therapy in patients with severe COVID-19 over 3 years. MSC treatment may offer potential benefits for lung recovery and improved quality of life in patients experiencing Long COVID symptoms. Trial registration : ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04288102.

Emerging evidence suggests that mechanosensation (the ability of the skeletal system to perceive mechanical and biochemical signals) mediated by abnormal mechanical loading plays a critical role in the regulation of IVD health. This review examines the complex interactions amongIVDs, intraosseous sensory mechanisms, and the central nervous system (CNS), with a particular focus on the roles of pathways such as PGE2/EP4, Wnt/β-catenin, and NF-κB. This review elucidates the manner in which mechanical stress and aberrant signaling disrupt the homeostasis of the nucleus pulposus (NP), cartilaginous endplate (CEP) and annulus fibrosus (AF), thereby driving degeneration and exacerbating pain. Furthermore, targeted therapeutic strategies, including the modulation of skeletal interoception and dynamic mechanical loading, present novel avenues for reversing IVDD progression. By integrating skeletal biology with spinal pathology, this work offers a novel perspective on the pathogenesis of IVDD and identifies promising strategies for clinical intervention. These findings highlight the potential of targeting skeletal interoception to mitigate IVDD and associated pain, paving the way for innovative, mechanism-driven therapies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218847399

FPLD is a severe metabolic disorder that often leads to cardiovascular and skeletal muscle complications. How LMNA mutations affect the functional properties of skeletal muscles is still not well understood. In the present project, we investigated the LMNA-R482L mutation-specific alterations in a transgenic mouse C2C12 cell line of myoblasts. Using single-cell RNA sequencing we have studied transcriptional diversity of cultured in vitro C2C12 cells. The LMNA-R482L mutation induces changes in C2C12 cluster composition and increases the expression of genes related to connective tissue development, oxidative stress, stress defense, and autophagy in a population-specific manner. Bulk RNA-seq confirmed these results and revealed the dysregulation of carbohydrate metabolism in differentiated R482L myotubes that was supported by ATP production profile evaluation. The measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and glutathione accumulation in myoblasts and myotubes indicates R482L mutation-related dysregulation in mechanisms that control ROS production and scavenging through antioxidant glutathione system. The increased accumulation of autophagy-related structures in R482L myoblasts was also shown. Overall, our experiments showed a connection between the redox status and metabolic alterations with skeletal muscle pathological phenotypes in cells bearing pathogenic LMNA mutation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218844957

Its genetic etiology is highly heterogeneous and not yet fully understood. Limited by short-read sequencing, the profile and structural variation of the full-length transcript for POI have remained elusive. Therefore, this study included peripheral blood samples from 5 POI patients and 5 controls, characterizing full-length transcripts of POI using Oxford Nanopore sequencing firstly. Ultimately, we identified 26,122 transcripts, including 7,724 novel gene loci and 13,593 novel transcripts. A total of 382 differentially expressed transcripts were identified, including 366 down-regulated and 16 up-regulated transcripts. Based on transcript structure variant analysis, 8,834 alternative splicing events, 65,254 alternative polyadenylation sites and 32 motifs were further identified, revealing the diversity sources of transcript isoforms, proteins and genetic complexity. Enrichment analysis of differentially AS genes suggested that the ferroptosis pathway may play an important role in the pathogenesis of POI.Additionally, 494 high-confidence lncRNAs, 1,768 transcription factors, and novel gene-coding regions were predicted based on full-length transcript sequence. Analysis of immune cell subtypes revealed the expression of CD8 + T cells and monocytes were down-regulated in POI, which was significantly positively correlated with AMH, suggesting that CD8 + T cells and monocytes could serve as potential diagnostic markers and immunotherapy targets for POI.

Methods: LINC00673 expression was detected in PDLSCs by qRT-PCR performed during osteogenic differentiation. By using alkaline phosphatase and Alizarin red S staining, we were able to confirm the role of LINC00673 in regulating osteogenesis in PDLSCs. Assays were performed on nude mice to test bone regeneration in the dorsal region to investigate MiR-188-3p’s binding to LINC00673 and leptin (LEP). Western blot was used to detect osteoblast markers (COL1, ALP and RUNX2). Results: As predicted, miR-188-3p interacts with LINC00673 directly, and miR-188-3p overexpression increases osteogenic differentiation. However, overexpression of LINC00673 reversed this effect, suggesting that LINC00673 functions as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-188-3p. A regulatory network formed by LINC00673 and miR-188-3p regulates the expression of LEP, a gene that inhibits the canonical Wnt pathway, reducing bone formation in PDLSCs. Conclusions: PDLSCs differentiate osteogenically as a result of a regulatory network between lncRNA and miRNA (microRNA), which may serve as a therapeutic target for diabetes-related periodontitis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218838629

Methods: MLO-Y4 cells were treat with PBS or 10 µM ICA for 24 h and the supernatant was collected. Exosomes were isolated and purified according to standard methods, and identified by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and protein blotting. Exosomal miRNAs were analysed by RNA sequencing. Results: Osteocyte exosomes were successfully isolated and characterised. MiRNA sequencing showed that two known exosomal miRNAs (miR-128-3p, miR-30a-5p) were significantly up-regulated and two were significantly down-regulated (miR-5112, miR-1285) after ICA intervention. Conclusion: Based on the findings, ICA regulates several miRNAs of osteocytes, which deepen our understanding of the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of ICA on skeletal diseases. The translational potential of this article: Osteocytes are the most abundant cell type in bone tissue, of which the impact on bone homeostasis is still not clear. This study explored the impact of icaritin on osteocytes and their derived exosomes. By doing so, we hope to contribute to the understanding the therapeutic potential of ICA and osteocytes in maintaining bone health and treating conditions such as osteoporosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218834436

C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into three groups: a sham group, a FLASH-irradiated group, and a CONV-irradiated group. A whole-body irradiation with a single dose of 3 Gy (200 Gy/s for FLASH group and 0.3 Gy/s for CONV group) using electron rays was used to establish models of lung injury. After 3 months, lung tissues were stained with HE and Masson stains to observe pathological changes in lung tissue and subjected to 4D-Fast DIA quantitative proteomics, with the sequencing data validated by Western blot and immunofluorescence. The mice in FLASH group had less lung tissue damage and lower levels of fibrosis compared to the CONV group. Proteomic sequencing showed significant differences in CCT6b protein expression between the two irradiation groups. As verified by the WB and immunofluorescence assays, the expression level of CCT6b was significantly reduced in the CONV group of mice compared with the SHAM and FLASH groups. With the down-regulation of CCT6b, there was a notable decrease in the expression of E-cadherin, accompanied by an increase in the expression of α-smooth muscle actin and Vimentin. The differential response in the level of lung fibrosis caused by the two types of radiation may be related to the level of CCT6b expression, but the specific mechanism of action needs to be further investigated. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218832399

Healthcare professionals (HCPs) self-medication practice (SMP) with antibiotics is a concerning practice. The role of knowledge, and attitudes, in shaping SMP has not been explored, in the context of Ethiopia. This study aims to investigate the patterns of antibiotic use, knowledge, attitudes, and associated the factors with SMP among healthcare professionals in tertiary hospitals in Bahir Dar, North West Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2023 to February 2024 in two tertiary hospitals in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. The study included 410 healthcare professionals selected using proportional allocation and convenience sampling. A structured, self-administered questionnaire was used to assess participants’ demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding antibiotic use. Knowledge was assessed through scoring, and attitudes were evaluated using a Likert scale. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 27.0, employing bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with SMA. Knowledge assessment revealed that 58.5% had good knowledge. In terms of job categories, nurses comprised the largest group (48.8%). A majority (60.2%) had 1–5 years of experience. 57.8% of participants exhibited a poor attitude to SMP. Respiratory infections (20.61%) were the most common health condition reported, followed by gastrointestinal infections (15.43%). The most frequently used antibiotics were amoxicillin (35%), augmentin (25%), and azithromycin (25%). Key factors influencing SMA included ease of access to antibiotics (36%), cost-effectiveness (23%), and knowledge/expertise (22%). Time constraints, perceived severity of conditions, and past self-medication experiences were also significant factors. While 83.8% considered self-medication to be safe, 75% recognized the potential adverse effects of medications. The multivariate analysis revealed that being a physician (AOR = 23.39) or a pharmacist (AOR = 7.79) was strongly associated with self-medication. Degree holders, MSc holders, and specialized physicians were also more likely to self-medicate. A poor attitude was a significant determinant, with healthcare professionals displaying poor attitudes being almost twice as likely to self-medicate (AOR = 1.91). The findings highlight the prevalent practice of self-medication with antibiotics among healthcare professionals in Ethiopia, influenced by factors such as knowledge, access to antibiotics, and professional attitudes. The study highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions to enhance healthcare professionals’ knowledge and attitudes regarding responsible antibiotic use while addressing their own practices of self-medication. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218830616

Recent research has found that IR damage is involved in severe mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial biosynthesis and dynamics control mitochondrial mass, distribution, and function. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is widely known for preserving health and functionality of mitochondria. DEX has been proven to alleviate liver damage through antioxidant and anti-apoptotic pathways. But it’s unclear how DEX protects mitochondria at this time. In this research, the mechanism behind the protective benefits of DEX was examined using the rat liver IR model and the rat liver cells (BRL-3 A) hypoxia reoxygenation (HR) model. We discovered that DEX treatment restored mitochondrial membrane potential, promoted ATP production, prevented oxidative stress, and decreased apoptosis in BRL-3 A cells. Furthermore, HR damage increased mitochondrial fission while decreasing mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis in BRL-3 A cells, which DEX partially corrected. The benefits of DEX on mitochondrial protection were reversed after addition of SR-18,292. Additionally, DEX showed the ability to enhance SIRT3 expression, and after cells were transfected with SIRT3 siRNA, DEX’s effects on mitochondria were partially prevented. Similarly, in the rat model, DEX alleviating liver histopathological injury and oxidative stress. DEX inhibited IR-induced mitochondrial damage through improving ETC complex I- IV activities and ATP content, reducing apoptosis, controlling mitochondrial quality, and upregulating the expression of SIRT3. Additionally, our research shows that DEX’s ability to protect the liver against IR damage is mediated by the modulation of mitochondrial quality control. Overall, the modification of SIRT3 activity could be responsible for this outcome. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218820553

The predominant disease risk factors — obesity and joint injury — are well recognized and modifiable. A greater understanding of the complex mechanisms, including inflammatory, metabolic and post-traumatic processes, that can lead to disease and of the pathophysiology of pain is helping to delineate mechanistic targets. Currently, management is primarily focused on alleviating the main symptoms of pain and obstructed function through lifestyle interventions such as self-management programmes, education, physical activity, exercise and weight management. However, lack of adherence to known effective osteoarthritis therapeutic strategies also contributes to the high global disease burden. For those who have persistent symptoms that are compromising quality of life and have not responded adequately to core treatments, joint replacement is an option to consider. The burden imparted by the disease causes a substantial impact on individuals affected in terms of quality of life.

However, the particular mechanisms of ERS and MD related genes (ERS&MDRGs) in osteoporosis (OP) have not been elucidated. In present study, biomarkers related to ERS and MD in OP were identified. Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained based on GEO dataset. ERS&MDRGs were derived from Genecard database. Initially, ERS&MD related DEGs (ERS&MDRDEGs) were obtained by overlapping DEGs and ERS&MDRGs. The key module was screened by WGCNA. The intersection of ERS&MDRDEGs and key module was screened by machine learning to obtain key genes. Then, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was drawn to calculated diagnostic accuracy of key genes. The ssGSEA and Cibersort algorithms were performed to analyze immune cell infiltration. The miRNA-mRNA-TF network were draw by cytoscape software. Moleculaer docking and DGIdb database were employed for screening potential drugs. Finally, the expression of key genes was verified by qRT-PCR. Results: The 122 ERS&MDRDEGs were obtained by preliminary screening. ERS&MDRDEGs were mainly enriched in lipid metabolism, calcium ion transport, and ossification. The 5 key genes were identified, including AAAS, ESR1, SLC12A2, TAF15, and VAMP2. Immune infiltration analysis showed monocyte and macrophage were different between OP and control groups. The miRNA-mRNA-TF regulatory network indicated has-miR-625-5p, has-miR-296-3p, CTCT and EP300 as potential regulatory targets. The 2 potential small molecule drugs, namely bumetanide and elacestrant were screened. The expression of AAAS, ESR1, VAMP2 were higher, and SLC12A2 and TAF15 were lower in OP than control group. Conclusion: This research identified 5 key genes AAAS, ESR1, SLC12A2, TAF15 and VAMP2. Bumetanide and elacestrant were potential drugs.

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effect of combining platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment with AOT on postoperative functional and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes in patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs) accompanied by chronic lateral ankle instability (CLAI). Methods: This retrospective study had a minimum follow-up period of 1 year. Thiry-nine patients with CLAI who underwent AOT between 2019 and 2023 were included in this study. Of these, 21 and 18 received AOT combined with PRP treatment (AOT + PRP group) and AOT alone (AOT-alone group), respectively. Preoperative and postoperative follow-up assessments were performed using the visual analog scale (VAS), American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS), and foot and ankle ability measure-sport scale (FAAM-sport scale). The final follow-up MRI was evaluated using the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) 2.0 ankle scoring system. Results: Both groups showed a significant reduction in VAS scores and significant improvements in AOFAS and FAAM-sport scale scores at the final follow-up compared with the preoperative values. No significant differences were observed in the final follow-up VAS, AOFAS, FAAM-sport scale, and MOCART 2.0 ankle scores between the groups. However, significant between-group differences were found at postoperative months 1 (P < 0.001) and 3 (P = 0.031) for VAS scores and at postoperative month 3 for FAAM-sport scale scores (P = 0.005).

The growth of cashmere fibre initiates when the relatively inactive telogen stage transitions to the anagen stage, which involves active proliferation. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this process are still unclear. Here, SWATH mass spectrometry (MS), a comparative proteomic analysis, was conducted to examine the proteomic alterations in Inner Mongolia cashmere goat skin samples at two different developmental stages (anagen and telogen). In total, 2414 proteins were detected, with 631 proteins showing differential regulation (503 upregulated proteins and 128 downregulated proteins). Bioinformatic analysis revealed that these proteins, which are differentially regulated, play crucial roles in the pathways associated with metabolism and fatty acids according to the GO and KEGG analyses. Furthermore, interactome analysis revealed that differentially regulated keratins have a crucial impact. The localization of KRT25, KRT71, and KRT82 using immunohistochemistry revealed that these proteins were expressed in the secondary hair follicles of cashmere goat skin.

This study evaluates the therapeutic potential of human fetal lung-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hFL-MSCs) in an experimental model of ALI. Our proof-of-concept findings suggest a paradigm shift in the approach to cell sourcing for lung diseases, proposing that fetal lung cells may be potential targets for stem cell differentiation studies when the derived cells are intended to be used for lung cell therapy. After characterizing hFL-MSCs, 18-week fetal lung cells were intratracheally instilled into rats with bleomycin-induced ALI. All the animals were evaluated on days 3 − 28 post-injury for cell count and the cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lung wet/dry weight ratio, lung tissue histological staining and expression of an extracellular matrix component, inflammatory and fibrotic genes. The findings confirm mesenchymal stem cell identity of the isolated cells and stability in their cell cycle distribution. Analysis of BALF showed that immune cell response to acute inflammation and adaptive immunity was significantly ameliorated by cell therapy with hFL-MSCs. Same results were confirmed by the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10 and NO in BALF, the lung wet/dry weight ratio and histopathological analysis of lung tissues after H&E and Masson’s trichrome staining. Effective modulation of key pro-inflammatory (Il6, Tnf, Il1b), pro-fibrotic (Tgfb1) and Col1a1 genes were also confirmed after therapy with hFL-MSCs. Our findings suggest that fetal lung tissue-specific stem cells are viable options for lung cell therapy and could be considered as targets for engineering of regenerative cells for lung diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218710822

This study aimed to develop an animal model for anterior open bite and investigate the underlying histological and molecular mechanisms of TMJ changes, with the expectation of contributing to the MAC surgery concept. Materials and methods: Thirty-six, 5-weeks-old female Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: (1) Bite-raise group (2-mm resin added to the upper molars at 5 weeks of age) (2), Recovery group (resin added at 5 weeks of age and removed at 13 weeks of age), and (3) Control group (normal rats). Micro-CT imaging was used to assess 3D morphology and bone structure. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to evaluate the cartilage changes, bone cell differentiation, and extracellular matrix degradation. Gene expression of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), TGF-β1, and Postn were measured by qPCR. Results: At 13 weeks of age, both Bite-raise and Recovery groups exhibited TMJOA-like changes, including decreased cartilage thickness and increased inflammatory gene expression. At 21 weeks of age, the Recovery group showed improved bone volume, reduced osteoclast activity, and lower MMP-13 and Postn levels than the Bite-raise group. Conclusion: These results suggest the successful development of an animal model for anterior open bite and demonstrate that MAC surgery facilitates the recovery of compromised condyles. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218705919

Iron plays an important role in the normal physiological activities of human body, and its abnormal metabolism is one of the risk factors of osteoporosis. Iron overload, as an abnormality of iron metabolism, has been reported to be associated with osteoporosis in recent years. However, the mechanism of iron overload involved in the process of osteoporosis is not fully understood. In this review, we summarize what we have learned about iron overload-associated bone loss from clinical studies and animal models. Starting from the three signaling pathways of Wnt/β-catenin, BMP/SMADs, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, the mechanism of iron overload affecting the process of osteoporosis was explored, we got the conclusion that iron overload accelerates the process of osteoporosis by inhibiting normal wnt signaling, suppressing the BMP-2/SMADs pathway, down-regulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to inhibit bone formation, and destroying the bone strength and load-bearing capacity, which providing a new direction for clinical treatment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218705687

It was therefore of interest to test ActRII ligands versus BMP ligands in settings of muscle differentiation and in vivo. Methods and results: In human skeletal muscle cells, both ActRII ligands and BMP ligands inhibited myogenic differentiation: ActRII ligands in a SMAD2/3-dependent manner, and BMP ligands via SMAD1/5. Surprisingly, a neutralizing ActRIIA/B antibody mitigated the negative effects of both classes of ligands, indicating that some BMPs act at least partially through the ActRII receptors in skeletal muscle. Gene expression analysis showed that both ActRII and BMP ligands repress muscle differentiation genes in human myoblasts and myotubes. In mice, hepatic BMP9 over-expression induced liver toxicity, caused multi-organ wasting, and promoted a pro-atrophy gene signature despite elevated SMAD1/5 signaling in skeletal muscle. Local overexpression of BMP7 or BMP9, achieved by intramuscular AAV delivery, induced heterotopic ossification. Elevated SMAD1/5 signaling with increased expression of BMP target genes was also observed in sarcopenic muscles of old rats. Conclusions: The canonical ActRII ligand-SMAD2/3 and BMP ligand-SMAD1/5 axes can both block human myoblast differentiation. Our observations further demonstrate the osteoinductive function of BMP ligands while pointing to a potential relevancy of blocking the BMP-SMAD1/5 axis in the setting of therapeutic anti-ActRIIA/B inhibition. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218703965

Human DF-MSCs which were isolated from the wisdom teeth of healthy donors and PRF were mixed and incubated in a 37 °C incubator for 1–2 h containing 1 million cells in 150 mg PRF. The mixture was suspended in a freeze-drying solution and then lyophilized. Wounds were created on the back skin of Wistar albino rats using a 6 mm punch. Lyophilized DF-MSCs, PRF, or PRF + DF-MSCs were applied to the wounds of rats. On the 15th day, the wound area was histopathologically evaluated in rats. Blood samples from rats were analyzed for total antioxidant status (TAOS), and inflammatory cytokine levels using ELISA. In both young and geriatric rats treated with lyophilized PRF + DF-MSCs, wound area began to significantly decrease from the 10th day compared to the untreated group (p < 0.05). Histopathological examination revealed that in the lyophilized PRF + DF-MSCs treated groups, epithelial integrity and scarless healing significantly increased compared to the untreated groups (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in TAOS, total oxidant status (TOS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL6), and hydroxyproline levels in serum samples from young rats on the 15th day.

Although the underlying mechanisms in humans are unknown, emerging evidence indicates that AIH facilitates corticospinal excitability to the upper limb. However, the functional relevance of this plasticity remains unexplored, and it is unclear whether similar plasticity can be induced for lower limb motor areas. We recently demonstrated that AIH improves motor adaptation, motor savings, and metabolic efficiency during split-belt walking. Thus, we hypothesized that AIH increases lower limb excitability and that these enhancements would predict the magnitude of motor learning and the corresponding reductions in net metabolic power. We assessed tibialis anterior (TA) excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation and quantified changes in spatiotemporal asymmetries and net metabolic power in response to split-belt speed perturbations. We show that AIH enhances TA excitability, and that the magnitude of this facilitation positively correlates with greater spatiotemporal adaptation. Notably, we demonstrate a novel association between increased excitability and reduced net metabolic power during motor adaptation and motor savings. Together, our results suggest that AIH-induced gains in excitability predict both the magnitude of motor learning and the associated metabolic efficiency. Determining indices of AIH-induced improvements in motor performance is critical for optimizing its therapeutic reach. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218700410

The present study assessed potential FoF predictors, among sociodemographic, physical, and mental health domains, and explored their structural patterns. This cross-sectional study is part of the Physical Activity Promotion & Domestic Accidents Prevention (PAP & DAP) project, and was targeted to a sample of 229 independent older people (M 14.0%, F 86.0%) aged over 60 (mean 70.5 ± 5.96), both normal and overweight (median BMI 25.8 kg/m2, Interquartile Range 5.24). Standardized tools were used to assess the variables: the Short Falls Efficacy Scale International for the FoF; an information questionnaire for the socio-demographic variables, the presence of diseases, and previous falls; the International Physical Activity Questionnaire for the PA level; the Senior Fitness Test for physical fitness data; the Short Form 12 questionnaire for variables in the mental domain; and the Psychological Well-Being Scale 24 for the psychological well-being. Correlation/regression analyses were used to explore relationships between FoF and the considered variables. A Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) was conducted to show graphical patterns projected into space dimensions. A percentage of 59.0 of the sample showed moderate/high concern of falling. The multiple regression model showed the following variables being significant predictors (p < 0.05) of the FoF: BMI (coeff 0.44, SE 0.104), musculoskeletal disease (1.55, 0.681), upper body strength (0.33, 0.117), mobility and balance (0.76, 0.320), perceived physical health (− 0.21, 0.047), and self-acceptance (− 0.52, 0.190).

We employed an interpretable machine learning (IML) framework including linear regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) models, and generalized additive models (GAMs) to analyze DAO/DAOA levels using 380 Taiwanese schizophrenia patients. Additionally, we incorporated 27 parameters encompassing demographic variables, clinical assessments, functional outcomes, and cognitive function as features. The IML framework facilitated linear and non-linear relationships between features and DAO/DAOA. DAO levels demonstrated significant associations with the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) based on linear regression. The Lasso model identified four features—HAMD17, age, working memory, and overall cognitive function (OCF)—and highlighted HAMD17 as the most significant feature, using DAO from chronically stable patients. Utilizing DAOA from acutely exacerbated patients, the Lasso model also identified four features—OCF, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms 20-item, quality of life scale (QLS), and category fluency—and emphasized OCF as the most significant feature.

Inter-α trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 5 (ITIH5) is an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein and has been identified as a myocardial marker of ICM. However, its diagnostic value in patients with ICM and its function and molecular mechanism in regulating cardiac repair and remodelling after MI remain unknown. Methods: Three microarray datasets including 117 ICM and 152 non-failing (NF) myocardial tissue samples were merged and analysed. Peripheral blood and clinical information were collected from 53 patients with ICM and 40 NF controls. The effects of ITIH5 on cellular interactions and cardiac remodelling was studied using ITIH5 RNAi adeno-associated virus and mouse MI model in vivo and in fibroblast–macrophage co-culture model in vitro. Results: ITIH5 was upregulated in the myocardial tissue and peripheral blood of patients with ICM and could be an independent risk factor for ICM. Experiments in mice suggested that ITIH5 promotes cardiac fibrotic remodelling at all phases after MI. Downregulation of ITIH5 increased the risk of death within 7 d after MI but inhibited ventricular remodelling and improved cardiac function on the long-term. ITIH5 promotes the primary cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) proliferation, migration, and improves survival rather than activiation. Morover, ITIH5 directly promotes macrophage tissue infiltration, maturation, and profibrotic phenotype transformation, thereby promoting fibrotic remodelling. By using fibroblast–macrophage co-culture model, we demonstrated ITIH5 enhanced the fibroblast/macrophage crosstalk manifest as macrophage profibrotic phenotype transformation and CFs activation, mainly by enhancing the hyaluronan stability, the ability of ITIH5 to bind macrophage CD44 receptors and the downstream activation of the signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 pathway in macrophages. Conclusions: ITIH5 could be used as a diagnostic marker for ICM. Moreover, ITIH5 expression was upregulated after MI, which accelerated ECM-fibroblast-macrophage interaction, thereby promoting macrophage profibrotic phenotype transformation, CFs activation, and cardiac fibrotic remodelling. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218695847

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been introduced as crucial regulators of CRC. lncRNA feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor 1 antisense RNA 1 (FLVCR1‑AS1) is suggested to play a significant role in the tumorigenesis of several cancers. The Wnt signaling pathway is the most deregulated pathway in CRC. Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism of function of FLVCR1-AS1 in CRC through FLVCR1-AS1/miR-381-3p/CTNNB1, LRP6, and FZD3 axis. Methods: The expression levels of FLVCR1-AS1 were analyzed in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, as well as across various CRC cell lines. In HCT116 cells, FLVCR1-AS1 was knocked down, and the subsequent effects on the expression levels of FLVCR1-AS1, miR-381-3p, and three genes were measured using real-time PCR. Proliferation differences were assessed through an MTT assay, while cell death was evaluated using flow cytometry. Results: The results confirmed that FLVCR1-AS1 was upregulated in CRC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. RT-qPCR validated that FLVCR1-AS1 has the most level of expression in HT29, HCT116, SW480, and Caco2; respectively. Knockdown of FLVCR1‑AS1 was significantly followed by attenuated viability of HCT116 cells; while resulted in enhancement of apoptosis and necrosis. Conclusion: These findings support the idea that FLVCR1-AS1 may act as an oncogene in CRC, and targeting FLVCR1-AS1/miR-381-3p/CTNNB1, LRP6, and FZD3 axis may be introduced as a novel target for CRC therapy and diagnosis in the future. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218693311

In this review, we searched different databases with various combinations of keywords to analyze the effects of Sema3A on osteoporosis. Sema3A promotes bone formation and inhibits bone resorption by directly affecting the osteoblast and osteoclast or indirectly targeting the nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system may be the main link between the central nervous system and bone metabolism for Sema3A. In the peripheral nervous system, Sema3A may improve bone quality via sensory nervous innervation. In addition, estrogen is found to regulate Sema3A levels to improve bone homeostasis. Lots of Sema3A agonists have been documented to exhibit anti-osteoporotic potential in preclinical investigations.

One of the core regulators of cellular ageing are telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences of TTAGGG that cap the ends of chromosomes and are maintained by the ribonucleoprotein complex, telomerase. Age-dependent progressive loss of the telomere ends eventually induces cell cycle arrest for the induction of either replicative senescence or apoptosis. It was previously established that overexpression of the 37 kDa/ 67 kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) increased telomerase activity and telomere length while concomitantly reducing senescence markers in aged normal cells in vitro. Therefore, it was hypothesized that elevating LRP/LR in vivo may increase telomerase activity and hinder the ageing process on an organism scale. To this end, aged C57BL/6J mice were treated/transfected to induce an overexpression of LRP::FLAG. Various physiological tests and histological analyses were performed to assess overall organism fitness as well as to discern the treatments’ ability at reducing tissue degeneration and atrophy. It was found that mice overexpressing LRP::FLAG displayed improved physiological characteristics and markedly less tissue degeneration and atrophy when compared to control and non-treated mice. Alongside these improvements, certain organs displayed increased telomerase activity with a corresponding elongation in average telomere length. In addition the overexpression of LRP::FLAG significantly improved various proliferative and anti-ageing associated proteins while causing a concomitant decrease in senescence associated proteins. These findings are therefore indicative of a novel function of LRP/LR delaying the onset of senescence, while also promoting healthier ageing through elevating TERT and telomerase activity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218691868

However, there is a lack of research demonstrating the use of autologous iMSCs for repairing articular chondral lesions in large animal models. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of autologous miniature pig (minipig) iMSC-chondrocyte (iMSC-Ch)-laden implants in comparison to autologous BMSC-chondrocyte (BMSC-Ch)-laden implants for cartilage repair in porcine femoral condyles. Methods: iMSCs and BMSCs were seeded into fibrin glue/nanofiber constructs and cultured with chondrogenic induction media for 7 days before implantation. To assess the regenerative capacity of the cells, 19 skeletally mature Yucatan minipigs were randomly divided into microfracture control, acellular scaffold, iMSC, and BMSC subgroups. A cylindrical defect measuring 7 mm in diameter and 0.6 mm in depth was created on the articular cartilage surface without violating the subchondral bone. The defects were then left untreated or treated with acellular or cellular implants. Results: Both cellular implant-treated groups exhibited enhanced joint repair compared to the microfracture and acellular control groups. Immunofluorescence analysis yielded significant findings, showing that cartilage treated with iMSC-Ch implants exhibited higher expression of COL2A1 and minimal to no expression of COL1A1 and COL10A1, in contrast to the BMSC-Ch-treated group. This indicates that the iMSC-Ch implants generated more hyaline cartilage-like tissue compared to the BMSC-Ch implants. Conclusions: Our findings contribute to filling the knowledge gap regarding the use of autologous iPSC derivatives for cartilage repair in a translational animal model. Moreover, these results highlight their potential as a safe and effective therapeutic strategy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218688375

This versatility offers a transformative approach to addressing the inherent limitations of conventional brain therapies, which frequently demonstrate low efficacy and significant adverse effects. This review delves into recent advances in understanding the intricate interactions between carbon nanostructures and cellular systems, highlighting their activity in brain therapy and neuronal sensing. We provide a comprehensive analysis of key nanostructures, including few-layer graphene (FLG), graphene oxide (GO), graphene quantum dots (GQD), single- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT and MWCNT), carbon nanohorns (CNH), carbon nanodiamonds (CNDs), and fullerenes (C<inf>60</inf>). Their unique atomic configurations and surface modifications are examined, revealing the underlying mechanisms that drive their biomedical applications. This review highlights how a deep understanding of the interactions between CNMs and cells can catalyze innovative neurotherapeutic solutions.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study with 294 patients, including 98 who received OSCA before dialysis (OSCA group) and 196 matched control by age and sex (control group). The primary outcome was cardiovascular events, and the secondary composite outcome included cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death post-dialysis initiation. The analysis of cardiovascular event-free survival revealed no difference between two groups (P = 0.228). However, when the OSCA group was further divided based on the duration of OSCA administration, the patients who received OSCA for ≥ 4 months presented significantly fewer cardiovascular events than those who received OSCA for shorter periods (P = 0.032). Multivariate Cox models revealed a reduced risk of cardiovascular events in the OSCA ≥ 4 months group compared to the control group (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18–0.84). Additionally, the OSCA ≥ 4 months group experienced significantly fewer composite outcome (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24–0.90).

Methods: Blood samples were collected from AML children and healthy volunteers. miR-224-3p and PTEN expression levels were measured. AML cells were pre-treated with Que. MiR-224-3p and PTEN expression levels in AML cells were altered via plasmid transfection. After intervention, PI3K/AKT phosphorylation, AML cell proliferation and apoptosis, concentrations of interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in AML cell culture supernatant, apoptosis-related genes Bax and Bcl-2, and autophagy markers LC3-I and LC3-II were tested. The targeting relationship between miR-224-3p and PTEN was identified. Results: MiR-224-3p expression was elevated in AML children, while PTEN was decreased. Que was available to accelerate AML cell apoptosis and restrain its autophagy. Que inhibited miR-224-3p expression and promoted PTEN expression. Upregulating miR-224-3p or downregulating PTEN weakened the effect of Que on AML cell apoptosis and autophagy. MiR-224-3p negatively modulated PTEN expression. Up-regulation of PTEN reversed the effects of up-regulation of miR-224-3p on apoptosis and autophagy in AML cells. In addition, Que inhibited PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation, while up-regulation of miR-224-3p or down-regulation of PTEN could attenuate the inhibitory effect of Que on PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Moreover, up-regulation of PTEN reversed the effect of up-regulation of miR-224-3p on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

Infiltrated macrophages play an important role in facilitating tissue regeneration. However, the intricate regulatory effects of hucMSC-sEV on macrophages during cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) remain unknown. In this study, we uncovered that hucMSC-sEV exhibited potent anti-inflammation and effectively inhibited the polarization of M1 phenotype macrophages. Mechanically, miRNA sequencing analysis and qRT-PCR indicated that a novel miRNA, named miR-13896, was enriched in hucMSC-sEV. When transfected with miR-13896 mimic, macrophages displayed M2 phenotype with elevated levels of Arg1 and IL-10, while miR-13896 inhibitor promoted M1 phenotype. Furthermore, we firstly established that miR-13896 repressed Tradd expression by targeting its 3' untranslated region and subsequently inhibited NF-κB signaling pathway in macrophages. Additionally, to improve therapeutic effects, hucMSC-sEV were engineered with elevated levels of miR-13896 through electroporation, which resulted in promoting M2 phenotype macrophages, inhibiting inflammatory factors, and enhancing kidney repair. Conclusively, our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of hucMSC-sEV on macrophages and AKI, while also highlighting electroporation as a promising strategy for treating cisplatin-induced AKI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218682225

Investigating viral interactions of human proteins may reveal mechanisms underlying these effects and offer insights for therapeutic interventions. This study explores molecular interactions of virus and human proteins that may be related to neuropsychiatric disorders. Methods: Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Influenza A virus (IAV) (H1N1, H5N1), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV1&2) were selected as key viruses. Protein structures for each virus were accessed from the Protein Data Bank and analyzed using the HMI-Pred web server to detect interface mimicry between viral and human proteins. The PANTHER classification system was used to categorize viral-human protein interactions based on function and cellular localization. Results: Energetically favorable viral-human protein interactions were identified for HSV-1 (467), CMV (514), EBV (495), H1N1 (3331), H5N1 (3533), and HIV 1&2 (62425). Besides immune and apoptosis-related pathways, key neurodegenerative pathways, including those associated with Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, were frequently interacted. A total of 38 human proteins, including calmodulin 2, Ras-related botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), PDGF-β, and vimentin, were found to interact with all six viruses. Conclusion: The study indicates a substantial number of energetically favorable interactions between human proteins and selected viral proteins, underscoring the complexity and breadth of viral strategies to hijack host cellular mechanisms. Further in vivo and in vitro validation is required to understand the implications of these interactions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218681362

This study introduces NaGdF<inf>4</inf> nanoparticles (NPs) modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and cholesterol (CLS) to enhance hydrophilicity and lipophilicity. Targeting is achieved using a matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP13) cartilage-binding peptide.

Two hours post-injection, these NPs improved the signal-to-noise ratio at injury sites by 2.4-fold over pre-injection values. Biocompatibility was confirmed with no adverse effects in blood or organs, and the NPs were metabolized in kidneys and liver, with excretion via urine.

While several functions have been described in other tissues, the roles of CAV1 and CAV2 in the ocular surface have remained unknown. In the current study, we investigated the expression and function of CAV1 and CAV2 in the human cornea. We found CAV1 and CAV2 to be preferentially expressed by proliferative Basal Cell Adhesion Molecule (BCAM)-positive progenitor cells along the entire limbal and corneal basal epithelial layer. Functional gene knockdown studies reveal that BCAM, BCAM co-expressed Laminin α5 (LAMA5) and Laminin α3 (LAMA3) regulate expression of CAV2. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that CAV1 and CAV2 contribute to enhanced BCAM-positive cell proliferation through regulation of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) cell surface expression. In aggregate, our study identifies specific expression of CAV1 and CAV2 in BCAM-positive corneal basal epithelial cells and uncovers a novel CAV1/CAV2-dependent mechanism of corneal progenitor cell proliferation, with potential implications for therapeutic enhancement of corneal regeneration. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218679916

Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (ADSCs), which are abundant in the body, have the potential to differentiate into cartilage and may be a useful cell source for cartilage regeneration. If it is possible to fabricate ADSC-derived cartilage constructs that can cover the damaged area, this could lead to the development of a new regenerative therapy for OA that could replace the currently available treatments. We therefore sought to produce cartilage constructs with suitable thickness and biological properties, similar to native cartilage, using the bio-three-dimensional (3D) printer. We also investigated the culture protocol to ensure that the constructs were fully mature even at the internal site. Methods: ADSCs were isolated from three rats and expanded to create cartilage spheroids. The spheroids were arranged into patches using a Kenzan bio-3D printer to create scaffold-free, cell-only cartilage constructs. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was added during expansion culture and varying concentrations of bone morphogenetic protein2 (BMP2) were supplemented during chondrogenic differentiation. The levels of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in the spheroids and constructs were measured. The histology of the spheroids and constructs and the compressive strength of the constructs were evaluated. Results: The amount of GAG in the cartilage spheroids was higher in the bFGF and high-BMP2 concentration groups than in the non-supplemented and low-BMP2 concentration groups. Chondrocytes were abundant in the spheroids and constructs, and the extracellular matrix was homogeneously positive for safranin O staining and type II collagen immunostaining. The strength of cartilage constructs was consistent with that of the native cartilage (compressive strength 4.2 ± 1.5 MPa, n = 12). Conclusion: By optimizing the cell culture conditions, inducing chondrogenic differentiation, and bio-3D printing, we successfully fabricated fully mature cartilage constructs with mechanical and histological properties similar to those of articular cartilage. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218679396

This study aimed to explore the clinical significance and potential mechanisms of long non-coding RNA CRNDE in the development of HS. This study encompassed 71 HS patients, and the expression levels of lncRNA CRNDE were assessed via RT-qPCR. Concurrently, the concentrations of collagen I A1 and collagen III A1 were quantified using the Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, while the cellular activities of hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HSFs) were evaluated through CCK-8 assays, Transwell migration assays, and flow cytometry. Furthermore, a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to confirm the target interaction between CRNDE and microRNA -29a-3p. LncRNA CRNDE was markedly upregulated in HS tissues. Silencing lncRNA CRNDE led to a reduction in collagen I A1 and collagen III A1 levels in HSFs, inhibited cell proliferation and migration, and simultaneously promoted cell apoptosis. Moreover, miR-29a-3p expression was downregulated in HS tissues and exhibited a negative correlation with lncRNA CRNDE expression. The effects of lncRNA CRNDE knockdown on collagen I A1/ III A1 levels, cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis could be partially mitigated by a miR-29a-3p inhibitor.

However, the proliferative and differentiation capacity of MSCs has been limited by cellular senescence during the process of expanding culture.

We found that SETD7, a histone methyltransferase, was upregulated during ex vivo expansion of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAD-MSCs). Pharmacological inhibition of SETD7 with PFI-2 in hAD-MSCs cultures delayed their senescence, as evident by the diminished expression of senescent-associated genes and the maintenance of their proliferation and differentiation capacity. Upon transplantation, cell sheets derived from hAD-MSCs expanded with PFI-2 were better able to accelerate tendon repair.

While macrophage-mediated inflammation plays a central role in PAH, the specific contributions of m6A regulators within macrophages are not yet fully understood. This study explores the role of METTL3 in macrophages, with particular emphasis on its contribution to the progression of PAH. Methods: SU5416/Hypoxia (SuHx) PAH mouse models were treated daily with STM2457, a selective METTL3 antagonist, or vehicle for 10 days. Additionally, SuHx PAH was induced in Mettl3flox/floxlyz2cre + and Mettl3flox/flox mice using genetic approaches. Pulmonary acceleration time to pulmonary ejection time (PAAT/PAET) and right ventricular free wall (RVFWD) were measured by ultrasound. Hemodynamic parameters, including right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), were assessed. Pulmonary vascular and right heart remodeling were evaluated using HE staining, while vascular and right heart fibrosis were assessed by Masson’s trichrome staining. The expression of fibrosis-associated genes was quantified by qPCR. Macrophage activation in tissues was determined via CD86 and CD206 immunofluorescence staining, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines and fibrosis-associated genes was quantified by qPCR. Results: METTL3 expression was significantly upregulated in the lungs and macrophages of PAH models. Treatment with STM2457 reversed the progression of SuHx PAH, as evidenced by a reduction in RVSP, attenuation of pulmonary vascular and right heart remodeling, and decreased fibrosis in both the heart and lungs. Furthermore, the expression of fibrosis-associated genes in the right heart, including Col1a1, Col1a3, and α-SMA, was downregulated following STM2457 treatment and METTL3 depletion in macrophages. Both STM2457 treatment and METTL3 depletion resulted in a significant reduction in the number of CD86+ and CD206+ macrophages, accompanied by a suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and iNOS, alongside an upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and Arg1. Conclusion: STM2457 treatment and METTL3 depletion in macrophages effectively reversed SuHx PAH by modulating macrophage inflammatory responses and alleviating pulmonary vascular and right heart remodeling, as well as fibrosis. These findings underscore the role of METTL3 in PAH pathogenesis by regulating macrophage function and inflammation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218672751

As a natural anti-oxidant, squalene has been applied as a cosmetic additive. Nonetheless, the liquid oil state of squalene and its low solubility in water usually limits the practical application of squalene. Recently, phosphotungstate calcium nanowires has been synthesized to gelatinize oily solvents, making it feasible to fabricate stable oleogel formulation containing squalene. Herein, the squalene/phosphotungstate calcium nanowires (Sql/PWC) oleogel has been specifically designed and applied to treat skin photoaging. Such oleogel was comprised of oil-based structures that closely mimic the skin’s natural lipids, resulting in enhanced skin penetration, better retention of active ingredients within the skin, and superior stability as compared to traditional hydrogel, especially under UVB exposure. It was found that the application of Sql/PWC oleogel on UVB-irradiated skin successfully decreased epidermal thickness, increased dermal thickness, and promoted the expression of elastin, collagen and skin barrier marker. Meanwhile, RNA-Sequencing results further revealed that the Sql/PWC oleogel alleviated UVB photo-damage through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in the skin, which were key factors in the aging process. We believe this study will not only bring new perspectives for skin photoaging treatment but also promotes the broader application of oleogel in the cosmetics industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218643591

Traditional treatments, such as phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i), often fail to provide lasting benefits, particularly in patients with underlying health conditions. In recent years, regenerative medicine, particularly stem cell therapies, has emerged as a promising alternative for managing erectile dysfunction. This review explores the potential of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) and their paracrine effects, including extracellular vesicles (EVs), in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. MSCs have shown remarkable potential in promoting tissue repair, reducing inflammation, and regenerating smooth muscle cells, offering therapeutic benefits in models of erectile dysfunction. Clinical trials have demonstrated positive outcomes in improving erectile function and other clinical parameters. This review highlights the promise of MSC therapy for erectile dysfunction, discusses existing challenges, and emphasizes the need for continued research to refine these therapies and improve long-term patient outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218640513

While mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold potential for DFU treatment, further enhancement in promoting angiogenesis in the challenging DFU wounds is imperative. Methods: The differential expression of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors during both normal and diabetic wound healing was compared using quantitative PCR. MSCs derived from the umbilical cord was prepared, and the engineered MSC (MSCANG1) overexpressing both the candidate pro-angiogenic gene, angiopoietin-1 (ANG1), and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was constructed using a lentiviral system. The pro-vascular stabilizing effects of MSCANG1 were assessed in primary endothelial cell cultures. Subsequently, MSCANG1 was transplanted into streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic wound models to evaluate therapeutic effects on angiogenesis and wound healing. The underlying mechanisms were further examined both in vitro and in vivo. Results: The comprehensive analysis of the temporal expression of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors revealed a consistent impairment in ANG1 expression throughout diabetic wound healing. MSCANG1 exhibited robust EGFP expression in 80% of cells, with overexpression and secretion of the ANG1 protein. MSCANG1 notably enhanced the survival and tubulogenesis of endothelial cells and promoted the expression of junction proteins, facilitating the establishment of functional vasculature with improved vascular leakage. Although MSCANG1 did not enhance the survival of engrafted MSCs in diabetic wounds, it significantly promoted angiogenesis in diabetic wound healing, fostering the establishment of stable vasculature during the healing process. Activation of the protein kinase B (Akt) pathway and suppression of proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase Src (Src) activity in MSCANG1-treated diabetic wounds confirmed efficient angiogenesis process. Consequently, epidermal and dermal reconstruction, as well as skin appendage regeneration were markedly accelerated in MSCANG1-treated diabetic wounds compared to MSC-treated wounds. Conclusion: Treatment with MSCs alone promotes angiogenesis and DFU healing, while the engineering of MSCs with ANG1 provides substantial additional benefits to this therapeutic process. The engineering of MSCs with ANG1 presents a promising avenue for developing innovative strategies in managing DFU. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218636314

Genetic determinants of CSVD are poorly understood and have rarely been explored. One proposed mechanism behind SVD is the breakdown of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). An intact barrier relies heavily on appropriate pericyte (PC) coverage of BBB endothelial cells. FOXF2 and NOTCH3 are two genes implicated in PC development and maintenance, thus influencing PC coverage of brain blood vessels. The aim of this study is to investigate whether FOXF2 rs41300825 and NOTCH3 rs1043994 variants can be considered as candidate loci for CSVD in Egyptian patients, marking the first study of its kind in Egypt. The present study included 186 ischemic stroke patients, selected from neurology and psychiatry department at Ain Shams University hospitals. Patients were categorized into: Group I (SVD patients; n = 114) and Group II (LVD patients; n = 72). Genotyping was conducted for FOXF2 rs41300825 (G/C) and NOTCH3 rs1043994 (A/G/T) using RFLP-PCR, with results confirmed through Sanger sequencing and multiple alignments of sequencing using the MEGA X program. Results: Results showed that genotype analysis for FOXF2 rs41300825 displayed one band of 334 bp, indicating the GG genotype. The same was observed for NOTCH3 rs1043994 with one band of 665 bp, representing the GG genotype. Sanger sequencing and multiple alignments of sequencing using the MEGA X program confirmed the results. Conclusion: Neither FOXF2 rs41300825 nor NOTCH3 rs1043994 were able to differentiate between patients at risk of developing SVD and those susceptible to LVD.

Currently, conservative treatment options have low success rates, while surgical interventions often result in multiple complications. The altered state of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a pivotal factor in the onset of various diseases and likely plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of SUI, particularly through changes in collagen and elastin levels. Recent advances in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy have shown considerable promise in treating SUI by modulating ECM remodeling, thereby enhancing the supportive tissues of the female pelvic floor. MSCs exhibit substantial potential in enhancing urethral sphincter function, modulating connective tissue architecture, and stimulating fibroblast activity.

Although osteoclast stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC-STAMP) is implicated in Silicosis progression, its regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we detected elevated OC-STAMP expression in Silicosis patients and found that treatment with OC-STAMP siRNA can alleviate the progression of Silicosis in mice, suggesting the potential of OC-STAMP as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for Silicosis. Methods: First, rat models of Silicosis were developed at various stages. A suite of histological and molecular techniques, including Hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Masson, Prussian blue staining, and immunohistochemistry, along with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were employed to assess the expression levels of OC-STAMP, as well as indicators of ferroptosis and fibrosis.Second, MLE-12 cells were cultured in vitro to establish an OC-STAMP overexpression model, and the relationship between OC-STAMP and ferroptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry, and western blotting. Subsequently, to verify the role of OC-STAMP and ferroptosis in Silicosis progression, we administered OC-STAMP siRNA and Fer-1 to Silicosis mice respectively. Whole-body volumetric plethysmography (WBP) was utilized to assess the respiratory function of the mice, and Micro-CT was applied to detect the lung nodules in the mice. The levels of OC-STAMP, as well as indexes associated with ferroptosis and fibrosis, were assessed using Hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Masson, Sirius red staining, immunohistochemistry, and western blot analysis. The polarization of macrophages towards M1 and M2 phenotypes in lung tissues was analyzed by flow cytometry. Ultimately, the plasma expression of OC-STAMP in patients diagnosed with Silicosis was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: In vivo experiments showed that OC-STAMP accelerates the fibrotic process of Silicosis, which may promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation by triggering ferroptosis of alveolar type II epithelial cells, and thus promote the progression of Silicosis. Furthermore, in vitro studies indicated that OC-STAMP overexpression causes ferroptosis in alveolar type II epithelial cells which contributes to fibrosis. Notably, treatment with siRNA in Silicosis mice confirmed that OC-STAMP inhibition effectively mitigates ferroptosis and retarded the progression of Silicosis fibrosis. Plasma of patients with Silicosis exhibited elevated OC-STAMP levels. Conclusions: Overall, OC-STAMP induces ferroptosis and exacerbates fibrosis in Silicosis. OC-STAMP siRNA and Fer-1 mitigate abnormal collagen deposition and delay the progression of Silicosis. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of OC-STAMP as a novel biomarker for diagnosing and treating Silicosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218635180

Despite significant advances in cancer treatment over recent decades, these therapies remain limited by various challenges. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), a cornerstone of tumor immunotherapy, have emerged as one of the most promising advancements in cancer treatment. Although ICIs, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, have demonstrated clinical efficacy, their therapeutic impact remains suboptimal due to patient-specific variability and tumor immune resistance. Cell death is a fundamental process for maintaining tissue homeostasis and function. Recent research highlights that the combination of induced regulatory cell death (RCD) and ICIs can substantially enhance anti-tumor responses across multiple cancer types. In cells exhibiting high levels of recombinant solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) protein, glucose deprivation triggers a programmed cell death (PCD) pathway characterized by disulfide bond formation and REDOX (reduction-oxidation) reactions, termed “disulfidptosis.” Studies suggest that disulfidptosis plays a critical role in the therapeutic efficacy of SLC7A11high cancers. Therefore, to investigate the potential synergy between disulfidptosis and ICIs, this study will explore the mechanisms of both processes in tumor progression, with the goal of enhancing the anti-tumor immune response of ICIs by targeting the intracellular disulfidptosis pathway. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218627784

At the end of the trial, the changes in spherical equivalent refractive (SER) and axial length (AL) before and after treatment were compared between the PBM group and the control group to evaluate the effectiveness of PBM in preventing myopia. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT), ganglion cell layer thickness (GCLT), central point retinal thickness (CPRT), 3-mm subfield central retinal thickness (3 mm-CRT), superficial retinal vascular density (SCP), and central choroid thickness (CCT) were self-compared to assess the safety of PBM.

Exosomes from Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (huc-MSCs) show potential in managing glycolipid metabolism and the immune response. Therefore, further investigations are required to explore their application in NASH and the underlying mechanisms. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were fed with a western diet for 12 weeks to induce NASH, and huc-MSCs exosomes (MSCs-exo) were administered during the feeding period. The effect of MSCs-exo was evaluated by monitoring changes in body weight, fat distribution, blood glucose, and insulin levels, and analyzing pathological alterations in liver tissue. Mechanism investigations were carried out using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, and other experimental techniques. Results: MSCs-exo could reduce liver fat, inflammation, fibrosis, and improved metabolism to alleviate the progression of NASH. Besides, MSCs-exo could decrease macrophage accumulation in the liver, encouraging M2 over M1 macrophage polarization. Furthermore, our study found that MSCs-exo had a high expression of miR-24-3p, which may regulate macrophage polarization by targeting the interferon-stimulated genes (STING) gene in macrophages, with its overexpression amplifying MSCs-exo’s NASH benefits. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the therapeutic effect of MSCs-exo on NASH may be attributed to the regulation of macrophage M2 polarization through miR-24-3p targeting STING.

This study explores the therapeutic potential of GATM/Gel hydrogel, focusing on its ability to enhance cardiac repair and functionality after MI through modulation of inflammatory and repair pathways. Experimental approach: The effects of GATM/Gel hydrogel on cardiac recovery were studied in a murine MI model. HA-CHO and gelatin solutions were mixed in situ using a dual syringe with a static mixing needle, and the resulting hydrogel was applied directly to the epicardium during MI modeling, followed by repositioning of the heart and closure of the thorax. Comprehensive in vivo assessments-including echocardiography, electrocardiography, and histopathological analysis-were combined with molecular techniques such as RT-qPCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Key cellular and molecular changes were tracked, focusing on macrophage polarization, angiogenesis, and modulation of the TNF/TNFR2 signaling pathway. Key results: Employing the GATM/Gel hydrogel led to a substantial improvement in heart function, shown through enhanced ejection fraction and fractional shortening, and reduced infarction size compared to control groups. Mechanistically, the hydrogel promoted the polarization of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages and stimulated angiogenesis.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on data from patients with complex pfCD who underwent FiLaC™ from January 2019 to December 2020, including demographics, pharmacological regimens, and preoperative MRI assessments. Follow-up monitored fistula outcomes such as healing, remission, failure, and recurrence. Results: Among 49 patients followed for an average of 60.0 months, 31 (63.3%) achieved fistula healing, 3 (6.1%) showed improvement, 3 (6.1%) had non-healing, and 12 (24.5%) experienced recurrence. Significant differences were found between healed and unhealed groups in total fistula volume (TFV), number of fistula tracts, and perianal Crohn’s disease activity index (PDAI) (P = 0.036, P = 0.020, and P = 0.041, respectively). Multivariate regression analysis indicated TFV as a significant predictor of healing outcomes (P = 0.013). ROC analysis confirmed its predictive value for fistula healing in complex pfCD, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.729 (P = 0.008). The optimal threshold for TFV was 4.81 cm3, with a sensitivity of 61.1% and a specificity of 83.9%. The AUC for recurrence rates was 0.883 (P < 0.001), with sensitivity and specificity at 83.3% and 83.8%, respectively, using the same threshold for TFV. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve highlighted the predictive potential of TFV for fistula recurrence (P < 0.0001).

However, the microenvironmental stress present in patients with hyperglycemia can significantly reduce mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) viability under high-glucose conditions in the body, ultimately reducing their therapeutic effectiveness. Enhancing the survival rate of MSCs following cell transplantation remains a crucial challenge. This study investigates whether Quantum Hyperlight (QHL) can counteract the detrimental effects of high glucose (HG), thereby improving MSC survival, proliferation, and mitochondrial function. We aimed to evaluate the effect of QHL on cellular viability, proliferation, and mitochondrial activity in WJ-MSCs exposed to HG. MSCs were cultured in a medium containing normal glucose (NG) (1 g/L) and HG (4.5 g/L). MSCs in the HG medium were exposed to QHL for 90 s or 180 s with an energy density of 2.4 Joules/cm2/minute and an average power density of 40 mW/cm2. Then, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), MTT assays, and Mitotracker Green staining were performed to evaluate cell viability and proliferation. The viability of MSCs was significantly increased in the QHL-treated groups (84% in QHL-90 s and 86% in QHL-180 s) compared to the untreated HG group (65%, p < 0.001). PCNA expression in QHL-90 s and QHL-180 s groups showed significant increases (p < 0.001) compared to the untreated HG group. MitoTracker staining intensity was significantly higher in the QHL-treated groups compared to the untreated HG group (p < 0.001). The HG environment reduced viability, proliferation, and mitochondrial staining. In the context of the NG environment, MSCs exhibited notable differences. However, the viability, proliferation, and mitochondrial staining rates of MSCs were significantly higher in the HG conditions when treated with QHL compared to the group that did not receive QHL. This study introduces QHL as a novel approach to enhance the therapeutic potential of WJ-MSCs under HG conditions, demonstrating its ability to improve cellular viability, proliferation, and mitochondrial activity. This study highlights its potential as a pretreatment to improve clinical outcomes in regenerative medicine. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218503162

In this study, we investigated the heterogeneity of different subpopulations of Urine-derived stem cells (USCs) to explore the most suitable cell subtype for treating severe steatotic liver IRI. Methods: This study utilized scRNA-seq and Bulk RNA-seq to investigate the transcriptional heterogeneity between Spindle-shaped USCs (SS-USCs) and Rice-shaped USCs (RS-USCs). Additionally, rat fatty Liver transplantation (LT) model, mouse fatty liver IRI model, and Steatotic Hepatocyte Hypoxia-Reoxygenation (SHP-HR) model were constructed. Extracellular vesicles derived from SS-USCs and RS-USCs were isolated and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. The therapeutic effects of Spindle-shaped USCs Exosomes (SS-USCs-Exo) and Rice-shaped USCs Exosomes (RS-USCs-Exo) were explored, elucidating their potential mechanisms in inhibiting ferroptosis and alleviating IRI. Results: Multiple omics analyses confirmed that SS-USCs possess strong tissue repair and antioxidant capabilities, while RS-USCs have the potential to differentiate towards specific directions such as the kidney, nervous system, and skeletal system, particularly showing great application potential in renal system reconstruction. Further experiments demonstrated in vivo and in vitro models confirming that SS-USCs and SS-USCs-Exo significantly inhibit ferroptosis and alleviate severe fatty liver IRI, whereas the effects of RS-USCs/RS-USCs-Exo are less pronounced. Analysis comparing the proteomic differences between SS-USCs-Exo and RS-USCs-Exo revealed that SS-USCs-Exo primarily inhibit ferroptosis and improve cellular viability by secreting exosomes containing Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4) protein. This highlights the most suitable cell subtype for treating severe fatty liver IRI. Conclusions: SS-USCs possess strong tissue repair and antioxidant capabilities, primarily alleviating ferroptosis in the donor liver of fatty liver through the presence of GPX4 protein in their exosomes. This highlights SS-USCs as the most appropriate cell subtype for treating severe fatty liver IRI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218502696

An extract of garlic oil, diallyl disulfide (DADS), reportedly protects chondrocytes in vitro, with limited data available on its in vivo OA effects. We explored the efficacy of DADS in ovariectomy (OVX)-induced OA rats. Methods: In this study, thirty-four female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Twenty-three rats underwent a bilateral OVX and the remaining rats underwent a sham procedure. Six weeks post-surgery, five OVX rats and five SHAM rats were sacrificed. The histological methods and micro-CT were used to assess the success of the OVX-OA model. Meanwhile, six OVX rats were administered 100ul hydrogel and these rats were defined as the OVX + Vehicle group. Six OVX rats received 100ul hydrogel with 50 mg/mL DADS once, while another six OVX rats received 100ul hydrogel with 500 mg/mL DADS once, both by a single knee joint injection. The remaining SHAM rats received a single knee joint injection of equivalent saline. Four weeks post-administration, the bone mineral density (BMD) and subchondral trabecular microstructure were measured. Cartilage erosion was assessed by histological observation, while type II collagen (CII), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 in articular cartilage, and osteopontin (OPN) in subchondral bone by immunohistochemistry. Results: At six weeks after OVX, there was significant cartilage erosion and more bone loss in the OVX rats than the sham rats. At ten weeks post-surgery, DADS hydrogel significantly increased BMD and suppressed subchondral bone trabecular loss caused by OVX. Furthermore, DADS significantly rescued cartilage erosion and improved cartilage metabolism by decreasing MMP-13 and increasing CII expressions. Moreover, OPN expression increased in the OVX + Vehicle group than SHAM group; DADS inhibited this increase. Conclusion: These results suggest that DADS retards early OA progression in an OVX-OA rat model by improving cartilage metabolism and preventing the deterioration of subchondral bone microstructure, presenting a potential agent for ameliorating postmenopausal OA progression. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218502261

CD4 + T cells and signal lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic conjunctivitis, but their roles and interactions remain unclear. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional observational study enrolled 100 participants, 50 with allergic conjunctivitis and 50 healthy controls, to investigate the relationship between peripheral blood CD4 + T cells, SLAM expression, and allergic conjunctivitis. Participants were evaluated using the Aston university allergy questionnaire (AUAQ), ocular surface disease index (OSDI), and dry eye questionnaire (DEQ-5). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and analyzed for SLAM expression on CD4 + T cells using flow cytometry. Total serum IgE levels were measured using ELISA. Results: The allergic group demonstrated significantly higher AUAQ, OSDI, and DEQ-5 scores compared to the control group, indicating a more severe allergic and ocular surface disease burden. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a significant increase in SLAM expression on CD4 + T cells in the allergic group (22.6% ± 5.3%) compared to the control group (15.2% ± 4.7%) (p < 0.001). Total serum IgE levels were also significantly higher in the allergic group (255.3 ± 131.2 IU/mL) compared to the control group (36.7 ± 19.8 IU/mL) (p < 0.001). Spearman’s rank correlation analysis indicated significant correlations between AUAQ and OSDI scores (R = 0.38, p < 0.001), and between TBUT and OSDI scores (R = 0.21, p = 0.008), suggesting that reduced tear film stability is associated with more severe ocular surface symptoms. Conclusion: The study findings suggest a significant association between allergic symptoms, ocular surface disease, and immunological markers in individuals with allergic conjunctivitis. The increased SLAM expression on CD4 + T cells and elevated total serum IgE levels in the allergic group may play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of allergic conjunctivitis. These insights could inform the development of targeted therapies that address both the allergic and ocular surface components of the disease, potentially improving management and outcomes for patients with allergic conjunctivitis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218500702

Extensive research has elucidated that growth and differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), a constituent of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, exerts inhibitory effects on macrophage activation and mitigates inflammatory responses via the activation of TGF-β receptor type I (TGF-βR1). Nonetheless, the influence of GDF11 on spinal microglial polarization and its role in neuropathic pain remains to be ascertained. In the present investigation, a neuropathic pain model was induced via a spared nerve injury (SNI) procedure on the sciatic nerve in male mice. The impact of GDF11 on microglial polarization and neuropathic pain in SNI-subjected mice was evaluated through pain behavior assessments, WB, IF, qRT-PCR, and ELISA. Our findings revealed a significant downregulation of spinal GDF11 and TGF-βR1 expression levels in microglia of mice subjected to SNI. Furthermore, GDF11 treatment notably reversed the mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, inhibited M1 microglial polarization, and attenuated neuroinflammatory processes by modulating the SMAD2/NF-κB in SNI mice. However, the analgesic effects of GDF11 on pain hypersensitivity and its modulatory influence on spinal microglial polarization were abrogated by the application of a specific antagonist of TGF-βR1, or the TGF-βR1 siRNA. In summary, GDF11 effectively ameliorated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, suppressed M1 microglial polarization, and alleviated neuroinflammation via the regulation of the TGF-βR1/SMAD2/NF-κB pathway in mice with SNI. These findings suggest that GDF11 holds promise as a therapeutic modality for the management of neuropathic pain. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218500126

The interaction between endothelial and bone-forming cells, such as osteoblasts, is crucial for normal bone development and repair. Juxtacrine and paracrine mechanisms play key roles in cell differentiation towards the osteogenic direction, assuming the direct effect of endothelium on osteogenic differentiation. However, the mechanisms of this interplay have yet to be thoroughly studied. Methods: Isolated endothelial cells (EC) from human umbilical vein and human osteoblasts (OB) from the epiphysis of the femur or tibia were cultured in direct and indirect (separated by membrane) contact in vitro under the osteogenic differentiation conditions. Osteogenic differentiation was verified by RT-PCR, and alizarin red staining. Shotgun proteomics and RNA-sequencing were used to compare both EC and OB under different co-culture conditions to assess the mechanisms of EC-OB interplay. To verify the role of Notch signaling, experiments with Notch modulation in EC were performed by EC lentiviral transduction with further co-cultivation with OB. Additionally, the effect of Notch modulation in EC was assessed by RNA-sequencing. Results: EC have opposite effects on osteogenic differentiation depending on the co-culture conditions with OB. In direct contact, EC enhance osteogenic differentiation, but in indirect cultures, EC suppress it. Our proteotranscriptomic analysis revealed that the osteosuppressive effect is related to the action of paracrine factors secreted by EC, while the osteoinductive properties of EC are mediated by the Notch signaling pathway, which can be activated only upon a physical contact of EC with OB. Indeed, in the direct co-culture, the knockdown of Notch1 and Notch3 receptors in EC has an inhibitory effect on the OB osteogenic differentiation, whereas activation of Notch by intracellular domain of either Notch1 or Notch3 in EC has an inductive effect on the OB osteogenic differentiation. Conclusion: The data indicate the dual role of the endothelium in regulating osteogenic differentiation and highlight the unique role of the Notch signaling pathway in inducing osteogenic differentiation during cell-to-cell interactions. The findings of the study emphasize the importance of intercellular communication in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation during bone development and maintenance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218499680

However, the reasons why these senescence cells are resistant to clearance remain unclear. Methods: The mouse RISI model was established using an X-ray generator, and a shield was used to cover all areas except the skin of the right leg or back for protecting surrounding tissue. ScRNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, qPCR, western blot, primary cell co-culture system and fluorescence microsphere phagocytosis assay were performed for the functional and mechanistic investigations. Results: The dynamic changes of senescence cell levels and multiple immune cell levels during RISI were evaluated, we found that macrophages could remove senescence cells from the dermis, and the clearance ability gradually strengthens over time. ScRNA sequencing revealed that macrophages with high senescence clearance capacity exhibited increased NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) expression compared to those with low senescence clearance capacity. Inhibition or conditional knockout of Nlrp3 in macrophages led to senescence cell clearance dysfunction and impaired healing. Further studies found that interleukin-33 secreted by senescence cells inhibited the expression of NLRP3 in macrophages and their ability to phagocytize senescence cells, especially in the early stages after radiation. In addition, Nocardia rubra cell wall skeleton (Nr-CWS), an approved immunomodulator, was found to activate macrophage NLRP3 expression, reduce senescence cell burden, and accelerate the healing of RISI.

However, tissue availability, generation, and cultivation time represent important challenges for their usage. Therefore, the present study evaluated the efficacy of a specifically designed tissue preservation solution, TiProtec, complete or in absence (-) of iron chelators, for long-term cold storage of hPCLS. Methods: hPCLS were generated from peritumor control tissues and stored in DMEM/F-12, TiProtec, or TiProtec (-) for up to 28 days. Viability, metabolic activity, and tissue structure were determined. Moreover, bulk-RNA sequencing was used to study transcriptional changes, regulated signaling pathways, and cellular composition after cold storage. Induction of cold storage-associated senescence was determined by transcriptomics and immunofluorescence (IF). Finally, cold-stored hPCLS were exposed to a fibrotic cocktail and early fibrotic changes were assessed by RT-qPCR and IF. Results: Here, we found that TiProtec preserves the viability, metabolic activity, transcriptional profile, as well as cellular composition of hPCLS for up to 14 days. Cold storage did not significantly induce cellular senescence in hPCLS. Moreover, TiProtec downregulated pathways associated with cell death, inflammation, and hypoxia while activating pathways protective against oxidative stress. Cold-stored hPCLS remained responsive to fibrotic stimuli and upregulated extracellular matrix-related genes such as fibronectin and collagen 1 as well as alpha-smooth muscle actin, a marker for myofibroblasts. Conclusions: Optimized long-term cold storage of hPCLS preserves their viability, metabolic activity, transcriptional profile, and cellular composition for up to 14 days, specifically in TiProtec. Finally, our study demonstrated that cold-stored hPCLS can be used for on-demand mechanistic studies relevant for respiratory research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218499293

This study explored the feasibility of a microcarrier-based three-dimensional (3D) culture system for producing the exosomes (cEXO). Investigations were conducted to enhance production efficiency, ensure stability, and evaluate the therapeutic potential of cEXO for anti-inflammatory applications while assessing their safety profile. Results: The microcarrier-based 3D culture system improved efficient production of cEXO, yielding exosomes with acceptable profiles, including a size of approximately 81.22 nm, negative surface charge, and high particle concentration (1.32 × 109 particles/mL). Confocal imaging proved dynamic changes in cell viability across culture phases, highlighting the challenges of maintaining cell viability during repeated exosome collection cycles. Characterization via transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and zeta-potential measurements confirmed the stability and functionality of cEXO, particularly when stored at -20 °C. Functional assays showed that cEXO exerted significant anti-inflammatory activity in RAW264.7 macrophages in an inverse dose-dependent manner, with no observed cytotoxicity to fibroblasts or macrophages. Acute toxicity testing in rats revealed no adverse effects on clinical parameters, organ health, or body weight, supporting the safety of cEXO for therapeutic use. Conclusions: This study highlights the potential of a microcarrier-based 3D culture system for scalable cEXO production with robust anti-inflammatory activity, stability, and safety profiles.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is increasingly recognized as a promising strategy to improve neural function post-SCI, yet its precise mechanisms are still far from clear. The present study aims to elucidate how FMT influences motor function recovery and its underlying mechanisms utilizing a SCI mouse model. Methods: Mice with SCI received FMT from healthy donors. We used 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing to analyze the alterations of gut microbes. Pathological alterations in the spinal cord tissue, including neuronal survival, axonal regeneration, cell proliferation, and neuroinflammation, were assessed among experimental groups. Additionally, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to explore alterations in relevant signaling pathways. Results: Significant shifts in gut microbiota composition following SCI were observed through 16 S rRNA analysis. On day 7 post-SCI, the FMT group exhibited a significantly higher diversity of gut microbiota compared to the ABX group, with the composition in the FMT group more closely resembling that of healthy mice. FMT promoted neuronal survival and axonal regeneration, leading to notable improvements in motor function compared to control mice. Immunofluorescence staining showed increased neuronal survival, alleviated extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, diminished glial scar formation, and reduced inflammation in FMT-treated mice. RNA-seq analysis indicated that FMT induced transcriptomic changes associated with material metabolism, ECM remodeling, and anti-inflammatory responses. Conclusions: FMT restored gut microbiota balance in SCI mice, mitigated inflammation, and promoted ECM remodeling, establishing an optimal environment for neural recovery. These findings demonstrated that FMT may represent a valuable approach to enhance functional recovery following SCI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218496086

While HMGCL is involved in various biological processes, its specific role in osteosarcoma remains unclear. Methods: Using data from a public database of osteosarcoma patients, we investigated the expression and prognostic value of HMGCL. The effects of HMGCL on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of osteosarcoma cells were assessed using CCK-8 assays, wound healing tests, and transwell invasion assays. We explored and validated the specific molecular mechanisms by which HMGCL influences osteosarcoma through transcriptome sequencing. Finally, we established a subcutaneous tumor formation model in nude mice to investigate the function of HMGCL in vivo. Results: The expression of HMGCL is downregulated in osteosarcoma and correlates with the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. Overexpression of HMGCL can inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of osteosarcoma cells, as well as tumor growth in vivo. Through our investigation of the underlying mechanism, we found that HMGCL may inhibit the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway via its product, β-HB. This inhibition promotes the phosphorylation of ULK1, thereby facilitating autophagy in osteosarcoma cells and enhancing the malignancy of the disease. Conclusion: HMGCL inhibits the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway mediated by β-HB, thereby reducing the proliferation, migration, and invasion of osteosarcoma cells while promoting autophagy. HMGCL may represent a new target for the treatment of osteosarcoma, offering new hope for patients with this disease. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218494865

While smaller animals are preferred for bulk cohort studies, larger animals offer opportunities to investigate surgical procedures at proportions close to the human situation. Therefore, in a feasibility study, we investigated urethral sphincter deficiency in German landrace gilts and Göttingen minipigs to develop a model of urinary incontinence as a basis for future preclinical studies of incontinence therapies. Urethral sphincter deficiency was induced surgically by transurethral electrocautery and balloon dilatation, and the deficiency was determined by urodynamics after injury and during follow-up. In cryosections, sphincter injury was visualized by histochemistry. Results: Sphincter deficiency was induced in two cohorts and groups of four female Göttingen minipigs each (total n = 20) by two different treatments. One cohort of minipigs showed an initially significant urethral sphincter deficiency (treatment 1; n = 16, p < 0.001). However, spontaneous sphincter regeneration was observed within one to two weeks. The other cohort of minipigs (treatment 2; n = 4) displayed a non-significant reduction of urethral sphincter pressure and an increase in muscle strength over time as well. In contrast, German landrace gilts presented immediately after treatment with significant sphincter deficiency (treatment 1; n = 6, 21%, p < 0.001) and suffered from significant loss of sphincter function for at least five weeks (67%, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Göttingen minipigs inherit significantly superior sphincter regeneration capacities compared to landrace pigs. This difference may bias preclinical studies in urology and other fields and explain in part seemingly contradictory results from different animal studies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218494715

Here, we show that ZIKV induces tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) in placental trophoblasts which facilitate transfer of viral particles, proteins, mitochondria, and RNA to neighboring uninfected cells. TNT formation is driven exclusively via ZIKV non-structural protein 1 (NS1). Specifically, the N-terminal 1-50 amino acids of membrane-bound ZIKV NS1 are necessary for triggering TNT formation in host cells. Trophoblasts infected with TNT-deficient ZIKVΔTNT mutant virus elicited a robust antiviral IFN-λ 1/2/3 response relative to WT ZIKV, suggesting TNT-mediated trafficking allows ZIKV cell-to-cell transmission camouflaged from host defenses. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry of cells expressing wild-type NS1 or non-TNT forming NS1, we found mitochondrial proteins are dominant NS1-interacting partners. We demonstrate that ZIKV infection or NS1 expression induces elevated mitochondria levels in trophoblasts and that mitochondria are siphoned via TNTs from healthy to ZIKV-infected cells. Together our findings identify a stealth mechanism that ZIKV employs for intercellular spread among placental trophoblasts, evasion of antiviral interferon response, and the hijacking of mitochondria to augment its propagation and survival and offers a basis for novel therapeutic developments targeting these interactions to limit ZIKV dissemination. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218492540

We hypothesized that angiopoietin 1 (Angpt1) carried by PCEVs contributes to their therapeutic effects after sepsis. Methods: A cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis rat model was used in vivo, and the effects of PCEVs on vascular endothelial cells were studied in vitro. First, proteomic and Gene Ontology enrichment analyses were performed to analyze the therapeutic mechanism of PCEVs, revealing that the angiogenesis-related protein Angpt1 was highly expressed in PCEVs. We then down-regulated Angpt1 in PCEVs. The role of PCEV-carried Angpt1 on intestinal barrier function, PCs recruitment, and inflammatory cytokines was measured by using septic Sprague–Dawley rats and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR-β)-Cre + mT/mG transgenic mice. Results: PCEVs significantly improved vascular permeability, proliferation, and angiogenesis in CLP-induced gut barrier injury both in vivo and in vitro. Further studies have shown that PCEVs exert a protective effect on intestinal barrier function and PC recruitment. Additionally, PCEVs reduced serum inflammatory factor levels. Our data also demonstrated that the protein levels of phospho-PI3K and phospho-Akt both increased after PCEVs administration, whereas knocking out Angpt1 suppressed the protective effects of PCEVs through decreased activation of PI3K/Akt signaling. Conclusion: PCEVs protect against sepsis by regulating the vascular endothelial barrier, promoting PC recruitment, protecting intestinal function, and restoring properties via activation of the Angpt1/PI3K/AKT pathway. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218489247

It was also our objective to analyze the sensitivity of satisfaction scores in relation to the respondent’s sex. Methods: A cross-sectional, with a quantitative approach, was conducted. The study included individuals aged over 18 years. Participants were visiting a health facility at the time of the interview. All subjects signed an informed consent. Data were collected using a standardized self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 29. Results: A total of 3,445 subjects took part in the study, 72% were women. The 25–45 age group accounted for 55.1% of the participants, 71.1% of whom declared themselves single. In general terms, women always gave higher satisfaction values. Specifically, in relation to age, those between 25 and 35 years old, single and with secondary education were more satisfied with professionals, access and social action and support, especially in private care. Those who were 45 years old or older better evaluate the care process. Previous consultation experience had a positive effect on women’s satisfaction with professionals, facilities, access, social action and support and care process. On the contrary, the same areas of analysis, in hospitalization, were better evaluated by women without any previous experience. On the other hand, married or living together men were more satisfied with facilities and administrative services, and these services, as well as access, were better evaluated by those with less education. Men were also the most satisfied with the accessibility and costs on health centers, as well as hospital facilities. With regard to facilities and accessibility, the highest levels of satisfaction were found on the islands of Fogo and São Vicente. The highest level of dissatisfaction was found on the island of São Nicolau (facilities, access and social action and support), followed by the island of Sal (professionals and care process) and the island of Fogo (accessibility and administrative services). Conclusions: Our study suggests that the quality of healthcare services can be significantly improved, especially regarding access and accessibility to healthcare, drug policy and recruitment of qualified professionals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218482357

Conventional hormone replacement therapy (HRT) alleviates symptoms but fails to restore ovarian function. Our prior studies have demonstrated that the Huyang Yangkun (HYYK) formula effectively supports menstrual cycle frequency and alleviates menopause-related symptoms in POI patients. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the HYYK formula, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approach, in enhancing residual follicle activity in POI patients. Methods: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will enroll 102 women with POI, who will be randomly assigned to receive either the HYYK formula or a placebo for 24 weeks. Primary outcomes will be assessed through Hoogland and Skouby scores (indicative of residual follicle activity) and menstrual cycle regularity. Secondary outcomes include hormone levels (AMH, FSH, LH, E2), ovarian volume, antral follicle count, and clinical symptom scales, such as the Greene Scale and the Female Sexual Function Index. Safety assessments will involve routine physical exams and adverse event monitoring. Discussion: This is the first multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the efficacy of TCM in stimulating residual follicle recovery in POI patients. The trial rigorously investigates the potential of the HYYK formula as a therapeutic alternative for POI, aiming to deliver high-quality evidence that supports the use of TCM in POI management. This study will concentrate on stimulating residual follicle development in POI patients, offering a viable approach to delaying ovarian decline and generating compelling clinical evidence.

Therefore, the present study was conducted with the comparative aim of stabilizing the lumbar spine with 2-stage surgery and cement augmentation in osteoporotic patients. 66 patients selected through convenience sampling and randomly assigned to two groups: CAPS and 2-stage surgery. In the CAPS group, lumbar spine fixation was performed in a single stage, accompanied by cement augmentation. In the 2-stage surgery group, spinal stabilization was conducted in 2 stages. In the first stage, pedicle screws were implanted, followed by the pedicle screw anchoring process 6 months later. fusion rate, screw loosening, pain levels (VAS), and patients’ disability (ODI) were measured in each group. The fusion rate in the 2-stage Surgery group significantly increased. Screw loosening in the CAPS group showed a significantly higher difference. The rate of pain and disability in patients early postoperatively, in comparison to preoperative measures, significantly decreased in both groups. In the final follow-up, the CAPS group experienced a significant increase in pain and disability.

This study aimed to measure the trajectory of patients’ QoL during HSCT depending on the type of transplantation (auto vs. allo-HSCT). Participants completed FACT-BMT at four time points: on admission to the hospital, on the day before HSCT, six days after HSCT, and on discharge from the hospital. A total of 153 participants completed the study, 51.6% female (mean age 50.4 years). Most patients were treated with auto-HSCT (54.9%), while the remainder received allo-HSCT (45.1%). The analyses showed significant differences in the magnitude of QoL during the hospitalization period (p < 0.001). The overall QoL trend was parabolic, deteriorating from admission, reaching its lowest six days after HSCT, and then improving at discharge, but not returning to the baseline level. The trajectory of the changes in QoL was not influenced by the type of transplantation (auto-HSCT or allo-HSCT) (p = 0.901). QoL changes dramatically following HSCT.

Although computed tomography (CT) is widely used, its effectiveness in accurately identifying bowel strangulation is limited. The potential of radiomics models to predict the necessity for surgical resection in ASBO cases is not yet fully explored. Objectives: The aim of this study is to identify risk factors for surgical resection in patients with ASBO and to develop a predictive model that integrates radiomic features with clinical data. This model designed to estimate the likelihood of surgical intervention and aid in clinical decision-making for acute ASBO cases. Methods: From January 2019 to February 2022, we enrolled 188 ASBO patients from our hospital, dividing them randomly into a training cohort (n = 131) and a test cohort (n = 57) using a 7:3 ratio. We collected baseline clinical data and extracted radiomic features from CT images to compute a radiomic score (Rad-score). A nomogram was developed that combines clinical characteristics and Rad-score. The performance of clinical, radiomic, and combined nomogram models was evaluated in both cohorts. Results: Of the 188 patients, 92 underwent surgical resection, while 96 did not. The nomogram integrated factors such as white blood cell count, duration of obstruction, and preoperative infection indicators (fever, tachycardia, peritonitis), along with CT findings (elevated wall density, thickened wall, mesenteric fluid, ascites, bowel wall gas, small bowel feces, and hyperdensity of mesenteric fat) (p < 0.1). This combined model accurately predicted the need for surgical resection, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.761 (95% CI, 0.628–0.893) for the test cohort. Calibration curves showed strong agreement between predicted and observed outcomes, and decision curve analysis validated the model’s utility for acute ASBO cases. Conclusion: We developed and validated a CT-based nomogram that combines radiomic features with clinical data to predict the risk of surgical resection in ASBO patients.

The liver, however, plays a pivotal role in maintaining the organism's homeostasis due to its robust regenerative and metabolic capabilities. Nevertheless, the liver also undergoes the effects of aging, which can result in a range of metabolic disorders. The function of extracellular vesicles and the signals they convey represent a significant area of interest within the field of ageing research. However, research on liver ageing from the perspective of EVs remains relatively limited. Results: In the present study, we extracted liver tissue small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) of mice at different ages and performed transcriptome and proteome analyses to investigate the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and mechanisms. sEVs in the older group were rich in miR-23b-3p, which was abundant in the sEVs of induced aging cells and promoted cell senescence by targeting TNF alpha induced protein 3 (Tnfaip3). After injecting adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing miR-23b-3p into mice, the liver of mice in the experimental group displayed a more evident inflammatory response than that in the control group. Additionally, we found elevated miR-23b-3p in blood-derived-sEVs from patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that miR-23b-3p plays a pivotal role in liver aging and is associated with abnormal lipid metabolism. The upregulation of miR-23b-3p in liver EVs may serve as a potential biomarker for aging and metabolic disorders. Targeting miR-23b-3p could provide new therapeutic strategies for ameliorating age-related liver dysfunction and associated metabolic abnormalities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218476492

MG-63 osteoblast cells were grown to 80% confluence and seeded in fish gelatin hydrogel (LunaGel™) to form 3D spheroids within 3–7 days. Spheroids were seeded on Seahorse microplates and incubated in a LunacrossLinker™ (visible light crosslinking system) for 2 min to give hydrogel a mid-stiffness of 3.5 kPa. Cells were exposed to PBM either 660-nm or 808-nm at panel setting of 5 J/cm2 and 15 J/cm2 and then assessed immediate (15 min before analysing) and 24 h time points. Mitochondrial activity was determined using an XFe96 Seahorse analyzer. Data distribution was assessed, and parametric or non-parametric tests and compared the mitochondrial respiratory capacity across different experimental conditions. The study indicated that 660-nm and 808-nm PBM could modulate mitochondrial functions in osteoblasts. The maximal respiratory rate for the fluency assessed at 808-nm wavelength was increased when cells were assessed immediate post. Interestingly, the 660-nm PBM-treated cells showed a decrease in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) at the basal and maximal bioenergetic state at all time points (immediate and 24 h.) and fluency compared to the untreated control. The effects of 660-nm and 808-nm wavelengths on osteoblast mitochondrial function suggest that PBM demonstrates differential modulation of osteoblast metabolism and bioenergetics depending on the wavelength. These findings have practical implications in both research and clinical settings, offering insights into selecting specific wavelengths for therapeutic applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218475882

However, the effect of PEMFs on energy metabolism in wound healing remains largely unexplored. Therefore, our study aims to demonstrate the role of PEMFs on energy metabolism in wound healing. Methods: Scratch-wound healing assay and cell viability assay were performed for the in vitro study of the effect of PEMFs on cell migration and viability. Seahorse assay was conducted for energy metabolism analysis while holo-tomographic microscopy for fine changes of L929 cells. Mitochondrial membrane potential assay and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pH assay were performed for analyzing the changes of mitochondrial function. Results: PEMFs with specific parameter (4mT, 80 Hz) promoted cell migration and viability. Glycolysis stress and mitochondria stress test revealed that PEMFs-exposed L929 cells was highly glycolytic for energy generation. Besides, PEMFs enhanced intracellular acidification and maintained low level of intracellular ROS in L929 cells. Compared to control group, much more vesicles were generated and then transported to regions close to the nuclear in L929 cells treated with PEMFs.

Methods: Two researchers conducted a comprehensive search of Chinese and English databases from their inception until Dec. 2023. The literature screening and data extraction were then performed. Statistical analysis was carried out using RevMan 5.4 software. Results: A total of 42 relevant RCTs, involving 2,183 participants, were ultimately included in this study. These RCTs encompassed four types of rheumatic immune and bone diseases, namely rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), spondyloarthritis, systemic sclerosis arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, primary Sjögren’s syndrome (PSS). The systematic review indicates that MSC transplantation may improve spondyloarthritis, RA, PSS. The meta-analysis reveals that MSC transplantation significantly improved symptoms in patients with OA [VAS (visual analogue scale): bone marrow: SMD = − 0.95, 95% CI − 1.55 to − 0.36, P = 0.002; umbilical cord: SMD = − 1.25, 95% CI − 2.04 to − 0.46, P = 0.002; adipose tissue: SMD = -1.26, 95% CI -1.99 to − 0.52, P = 0.0009)], SLE [Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI): SMD = − 2.32, 95% CI − 3.59 to − 1.06, P = 0.0003], inflammatory bowel disease [clinical efficacy: RR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.67, P < 0.00001]. However, MSC transplantation may not improve the symptoms of multiple sclerosis and systemic sclerosis (Ssc). Importantly, MSC transplantation did not increase the incidence of adverse events (OA: RR = 1.23, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.65, P = 0.15; SLE: RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.51, P = 0.76; Inflammatory bowel disease: RR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.22, P = 0.96; Multiple sclerosis: RR = 1.12, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.53, P = 0.50), supporting its safety profile across the included studies. These findings suggest that MSC transplantation holds promise for several rheumatic and autoimmune diseases while highlighting areas where further research is warranted. Conclusion: MSC transplantation may have the potential to treat autoimmune and rheumatic immune diseases. Moreover. MSC transplantation appears to be relatively safe and could be considered as a viable alternative treatment option for autoimmune and rheumatic immune diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218472508

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have garnered increasing attention due to their significant roles in human diseases. Although research has demonstrated differential expression of circRNAs in AD, their specific functions in AD pathogenesis remain largely unexplored. Methods: CircRNA microarray was performed to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 and WT mice. The stability of circAPP was assessed via RNase R treatment assay. CircAPP downstream targets miR-1906 and chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) were identified using bioinformatics and proteomics, respectively. RT-PCR assay was conducted to detect the expression of circAPP, miR-1906 and CLIC1. Morris water maze (MWM) test, passive avoidance test and novel object recognition task were used to detect cognitive function of APP/PS1 mice. Microglial M1/M2 polarization and AD pathology were assessed using Western blot, flow cytometry and Golgi staining assays. CLIC1 expression and channel activity were evaluated using Western blot and functional chloride channel assays, respectively. The subcellular location of circAPP was assessed via FISH and RT-PCR assays. RNA pull-down assay was performed to detect the interaction of miR-1906 with circAPP and 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of CLIC1 mRNA. Results: In this study, we identified a novel circRNA, named circAPP, that is encoded by amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is implicated in AD. CircAPP is a stable circRNA that was upregulated in Aβ-treated microglial cells and the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Downregulation of circAPP or CLIC1, or overexpression of miR-1906 in microglia modulated microglial M1/M2 polarization in Aβ-treated microglial cells and the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, and improved AD pathology and the cognitive function of APP/PS1 mice. Further results revealed that circAPP was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm, and circAPP could regulate CLIC1 expression and channel activity by interacting with miR-1906 and affecting miR-1906 expression, thereby regulating microglial polarization in AD. Conclusions: Taken together, our study elucidates the regulatory role of circAPP in AD microglial polarization via miR-1906/CLIC1 axis, and suggests that circAPP may act as a critical player in AD pathogenesis and represent a promising therapeutic target for AD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218470512

To provide effective and comprehensive end-of-life care, nursing students, as future nurses, should have spiritual well-being (SWB) and a proper attitude toward the care of dying patients (ATCODP). The present study was conducted to investigate the relationship between the level of SWB and ATCODP of Iranian nursing students in 2019. Methods: This descriptive-correlational study was conducted on 139 nursing students at Bam University of Medical Sciences who were selected by the census method. To collect data, a three-part questionnaire consisting of personal information, the Paloutzian & Ellison SWB scale, and the Frommelt Attitude Toward Care of the Dying (FATCOD) scale were used. The data were analyzed by IBM SPSS version 20. Results: The mean age of the participants was 21.63 ± 3.23 years. The mean score of SWB in 98 (70.5%) nursing students was moderate, and 41 of them (29.5%) had a high score. The correlation coefficient between religious and existential health with a total score of SWB was 88% and 86%, respectively. According to Pearson’s test, a significant relationship was observed between ATCODP, SWB, and its dimensions (P < 0.05). Conclusion: A significant relationship was observed between ATCODP, SWB, and its dimensions. Considering that most nursing students have a moderate level of spiritual well-being, measures should be taken to improve it during their studies. Because improving SWB in students will prepare future nurses for better quality care of dying patients and enhance their positive attitude toward death. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218469825

However, the regulation of WNT expression in macrophages has not been studied. In the present study, we have discovered that activation of canonical β-Catenin signaling suppresses WNT expression in macrophages. EVs from these pre-conditioned macrophages promoted intestinal stem cell regeneration and mitigated intestinal injury. Method: ChIP-seq analysis and validation studies using recombinant DNA construct expressing Luciferase reporter under WNT promoter (e.g. WNT5a and WNT9b) were conducted to demonstrate the involvement of β-Catenin in the transcriptional regulation of WNT expression. The regulatory role of β-Catenin in WNT expression in macrophages was examined by treating these cells with a Tankyrase inhibitor. In addition, the gene expressing β-Catenin was deleted in macrophages using Csf1r.iCre; Ctnnb1fl/fl mice model. Both pharmacological and genetically modulated macrophages were examined for WNT expression and activity by qPCR and TCF/LEF luciferase assay respectively. Additionally, Csf1r.iCre; Ctnnb1fl/fl mice were exposed to irradiation to compare the radiosensitivity with their wildtype littermate. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from pre-conditioned WNT-enriched macrophages and infused in irradiated C57BL/6 and Lgr5/eGFP-IRES-Cre-ERT2; R26-ACTB-tdTomato-EGFP mice to determine the regenerative response of intestinal stem cell (ISC) and epithelial repair. Regenerative effects of EVs were also examined in mice model DSS induced colitis. Result: ChIP-seq analysis and subsequent validation study suggested physical association of β-Catenin with WNT promoters to suppress WNT expression. Macrophage specific deletion of gene expressing β-Catenin or pharmacological inhibition of Tankyrase improves the WNT expression in macrophages several folds compared to control. Transfusion of these preconditioned macrophages or EVs from these cells delivers optimum level of morphogenic WNT to injured epithelium, activates ISC regeneration and mitigated radiation induced intestinal injury. Intestinal epithelium in Csf1r.iCre; Ctnnb1fl/fl mice also showed radioresistance compared to wild type littermate. Moreover, EVs derived from WNT enriched macrophages can mitigate intestinal injury in mice model of DSS induced acute colitis. Conclusion: The study provides substantial evidence that macrophage-targeted modulation of canonical WNT signaling induces WNT expression in macrophages. Treatment with preconditioned macrophage derived WNT-enriched EVs can be a promising therapeutic approach against intestinal injury. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218465343

In this study, we report that circFUNDC1, a nuclear circular RNA, is markedly downregulated in nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) from patients with end-stage IVDD. CircFUNDC1 is derived from the gene encoding the FUN14 domain-containing 1 (FUNDC1) protein, which is essential for mitophagy and cell survival. Functional analyses reveal that circFUNDC1 plays a crucial role in maintaining extracellular matrix homeostasis by enhancing the expression of anabolic factors in NPCs. Additionally, we identified the transcriptional regulator cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) as a novel binding partner for circFUNDC1. Binding with circFUNDC1 recruits CDK9 via complementary nucleotides to the FUNDC1 promoter to stimulate the production of full-length FUNDC1 mRNAs and proteins, forming a positive feedback loop. Overexpression of circFUNDC1 protects NPCs from oxidative stress by promoting mitophagy, reducing reactive oxygen species levels, and inhibiting cellular senescence. Moreover, circFUNDC1 overexpression delays the onset of IVDD in an ex-vivo culture model. This study is the first to demonstrate that circFUNDC1 is vital for protecting NPCs from oxidative stress, suggesting circFUNDC1 as a potential therapeutic target for IVDD.

Besides fibro-fatty replacement and myocyte degenerative changes, inflammatory patchy infiltrates are found in myocardial histological analysis of ACM patients. Inflammatory cells could actively participate in ACM pathogenesis, contributing to the alteration of cardiac microenvironment homeostasis, thus triggering disease evolution. In order to characterize the immune-derived mediators involved in ACM pathogenesis, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ACM patients were characterized and compared to healthy controls’ ones. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a lower frequency of CD4+ T helper type 1 cells, NK cells, and terminally differentiated CD8+ EMRA+ T cells in ACM patients compared to age-matched controls. In contrast, a higher proportion of effector/memory FOXP3+ CCR4+ CD45RO+ regulatory CD4+ T cells (Treg) were found in ACM patients. Single-cell RNA-seq performed on isolated memory Treg cells (mTreg) from ACM patients and healthy controls identified 6 clusters characterized by specific gene signatures related to tissue repair and immunosuppressive pathways. Notably, interleukin 32 (IL-32) was the most differentially expressed gene in ACM patients mTreg with respect to healthy controls. Treatment of human cardiac mesenchymal stromal cells with recombinant IL-32 in vitro promoted lipid droplet accumulation and collagen deposition, thus identifying IL-32 as a new potential player in the immune-mediated trigger of cardiac fibro-fatty replacement in ACM. Overall, we here provide the first complete characterization of circulating ACM immune cells, revealing an abundance of Treg. The high expression of IL-32 in ACM Treg may contribute to accelerated cardiac remodeling in ACM patients’ hearts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218459725

Its complex pathophysiology involves an intricate interplay of molecular and cellular processes, including cytokine storms, oxidative stress, programmed cell death, and disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier. These mechanisms drive localized lung injury and contribute to systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Unlike prior reviews that primarily focus on isolated mechanisms, this narrative review synthesizes the key pathophysiological processes of ARDS across molecular, cellular, tissue, and organ levels. Main body: By integrating classical theories with recent research advancements, we provide a comprehensive analysis of how inflammatory mediators, metabolic reprogramming, oxidative stress, and immune dysregulation synergistically drive ARDS onset and progression. Furthermore, we critically evaluate current evidence-based therapeutic strategies, such as lung-protective ventilation and prone positioning, while exploring innovative therapies, including stem cell therapy, gene therapy, and immunotherapy. We emphasize the significance of ARDS subtypes and their inherent heterogeneity in guiding the development of personalized treatment strategies.

This, in turn, leads to an accelerated breakdown of muscle proteins, which exacerbates the ongoing deterioration of skeletal muscle and intensifies the severity of senile sarcopenia. This study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of miRNA-regulated autophagy in senile sarcopenia. Methods: The miRNAs associated with sarcopenia were screened, and the target genes of significant miRNAs were predicted. The effects of significantly differentially expressed miRNA-144-5p on cell aging and autophagy were validated in vivo and in vitro. Results: The inhibition of miR-144-5p enhanced the multiplication of mouse myoblasts, increased the expression of MHC and autophagic markers LC3II/LC3I and Beclin-1, facilitated the formation of autophagosomes in mouse myoblasts, and reduced the number of aging cells and the expression of senescence-related proteins acetylated p53, p53, and p21 expression in mouse myoblasts. miR-144-5p affects myoblast senescence, myogenic differentiation, and autophagy by regulating the downstream target gene, Atg2A. Inhibiting miR-144-5p markedly increased the grip strength of the posterior limb in old mice, and the CSA of old mice and young mice was also markedly increased. Conclusion: All experiments have demonstrated that miRNA-144-5p has a significant impact on the regulation of autophagy and the development of senile sarcopenia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218456022

Mice were divided into three groups: blank, model, and experimental. Skin photoaging was induced by eight weeks of UVB irradiation in the model and experimental groups. ADSCs (1 × 106 cells/120µL) were injected into the experimental group mice thrice over a 30-day period, using a syringe on one side and a multi-needle injector on the other side of the nude mice dorsum. Follow-up assessments one month post-injection included high-definition photography for wrinkle and needle mark analysis, histological evaluation of dermal thickness, collagen and elastic fibers. CD31 and Type I collagen levels were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, while MDA and SOD levels were assessed by ELISA assays. Post-UVB irradiation, significant photoaging signs were observed in the mice, including wrinkles and disordered collagen and elastic fibers. ADSCs treatment led to epidermal thinning, dermal collagen thickening, and improved collagen and elastic fiber organization. CD31 and Type I collagen expression increased, while MDA decreased, and SOD significantly increased. No significant differences were found between the injection methods. Multi-needle injector marks disappeared within 24 h, contrasting with syringe marks, and mass formation was reduced compared to syringe injections. ADSCs effectively ameliorate photoaging in mice. Multi-needle injector injections match the efficacy of syringe injections and offer advantages such as precise depth control and reduced mass formation, suggesting its potential as an effective tool for stem cell-based anti-aging treatments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218452649

We have previously shown that ColXα1 is expressed in breast tumor stroma, correlates with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and predicts poor adjuvant therapy outcomes in ER+/HER2+ breast cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for these effects are unknown. In this study, we performed bioinformatic analysis of COL10A1-associated gene modules in breast and pancreatic cancer as well as in cells from bone marrow and OA cartilage. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms of transcriptional and extracellular matrix changes which impact the local stromal microenvironment and tumor progression. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine collagen type X expression in solid tumors. WGCNA was used to generate COL10A1-associated gene networks in breast and pancreatic tumor cohorts using RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Computational analysis was employed to assess the impact of these gene networks on development and progression of cancer and OA. Data processing and statistical analysis was performed using R and various publicly-available computational tools. Results: Expression of COL10A1 and its associated gene networks highlights inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironments, which identify aggressive breast and pancreatic tumors and contribute to metastatic potential in a sex-dependent manner. Both cancer types are enriched in stroma, and COL10A1 implicates bone marrow-derived fibroblasts as contributors to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in these tumors. Heightened expression of COL10A1 and its associated gene networks is correlated with poorer patient outcomes in both breast and pancreatic cancer. Common transcriptional changes and chondrogenic activity are shared between cancer and OA cartilage, suggesting that similar microenvironmental alterations may underlie both diseases. Conclusions: COL10A1-associated gene networks may hold substantial value as regulators and biomarkers of aggressive tumor phenotypes with implications for therapy development and clinical outcomes. Identification of tumors which exhibit high expression of COL10A1 and its associated genes may reveal the presence of bone marrow-derived stromal microenvironments with heightened EMT capacity and metastatic potential. Our analysis may enable more effective risk assessment and more precise treatment of patients with breast and pancreatic cancer. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218449009

Our previous transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that the adrenergic α2 receptor (Adra2α) was highly expressed in ASCs from T2D mice compared to healthy controls. This study aims to explore the role of Adra2α on the characterization and therapeutic function of ASCs. Methods: Clonidine (an Adra2α agonist) or si-RNA was used to observe Adra2α on ASCs proliferation, migration, growth factors (HGF, TGF-β1 and VEGF) expression and secretion. T2D mice were treated with non-treated control or Adra2α knockdown T2D ASCs (namely NC ASCs or KD ASCs). Mice glucose levels, insulin sensitivity and other metabolic indicators were measured and compared. Results: Treatment of ASCs with Clonidine reduced the proliferation, migration, and growth factors expression and secretion of ASCs, while Adra2α knocking down ASCs showed opposite effects. This translated in vivo when T2D + KD ASCs could improve hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, reduce fat content in adipose tissues and livers, suppress body inflammation, and increase pancreatic β cell mass in T2D mice compared to NC ASCs. Conclusions: Adra2α plays a critical role in regulating the proliferation, migration, and expression of growth factors of ASCs. Suppression of Adra2α expression in T2D ASCs restored/improved their therapeutic effects. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218446851

Mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH2), an enzyme in the TCA cycle, was identified as an anti-aging target through activity-based protein profiling in present study. The expression level of MDH2 was positively correlated with the cellular senescence in Mdh2 knockdown or overexpression fibroblasts. Glibenclamide (Gli), a classic anti-glycemic drug, was found to inhibit the activity of MDH2 and relieve fibroblast senescence in an MDH2-dependent manner. The anti-aging effects of Gli were also further validated in vivo, as it extended the lifespan and reduced the frailty index of naturally aged mice. Liver specific Mdh2 knockdown eliminated Gli’s beneficial effects in naturally aged mice, reducing p16INK4a expression and hepatic fibrosis. Mechanistically, MDH2 inhibition or knockdown disrupted central carbon metabolism, then enhanced the methionine cycle flux, and subsequently promoted histone methylation. Notably, the tri-methylation of H3K27, identified as a crucial methylation site in reversing cellular senescence, was significantly elevated in hepatic tissues of naturally aged mice with Mdh2 knockdown. Taken together, these findings reveal that MDH2 inhibition or knockdown delays the aging process through metabolic-epigenetic regulation. Our research not only identified MDH2 as a potential therapeutic target and Gli as a lead compound for anti-aging drug development, but also shed light on the intricate interplay of metabolism and epigenetic modifications in aging. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218446704

Post-CA brain injury (PCABI) is a major cause of death and poor recovery in CA patients and the current CA treatments are not very effective. The microbiome-gut-brain axis has been found to significantly affect brain ischemia injury. Furthermore, in ischemic stroke patients, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), especially sodium butyrate (SB), have been observed to promote neuroprotective effects by modulating inflammatory response and microglial polarization in the cortex. However, the precise mechanism of SB on CA-induced injury remains elusive. Therefore, this research study established an oxygen–glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model using BV-2 microglial and HT22 cells to simulate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in vitro and a potassium chloride-induced CA mouse model to mimic CA in vivo. The data revealed that SB markedly improved neurological scores and reduced neuronal death and apoptosis. Moreover, it reduced M1 microglia and neuroinflammation in CA mice. In addition, SB increased intestinal integrity and alleviated systemic inflammation. The 16S rDNA sequencing analysis indicated that SB intervention mitigated CA-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and SCFA depletion. It was also observed that CA mice’s brain and OGD/R-exposed BV2 cells had substantially increased levels of MyD88, phosphorylated NF-κB p65, and TLR4 proteins, which were reduced after SB treatment. In summary, this study revealed that SB can protect against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury by controlling microglia polarization and microbiome-gut-brain axis to inhibit brain inflammation via the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218445616

However, there were rarely researches about human hair follicle-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HF-MSCs) in POF. Objectives: In this study, we compared the effects of HF-MSCs and human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HU-MSCs) on POF models to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods: Female mice received intraperitoneal cyclophosphamid for 10 days to induce the POF mice model. One week after drug withdrawal, the mice were randomly divided into four groups according to the tail vein injection of drugs, which were: Control group (CON), Premature ovarian failure group (POF), HF-MSCs treatment group (P–H group) and HU-MSCs treatment group (P–U group). Which Treatment once a week for 4 consecutive times. Serum and ovarian tissues were collected 2 weeks after the last treatment, and fertility was performed by mating. ELISA, HE staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were applied to evaluate the ovarian function, oocytes quantity and quality, and the mechanism was verified by qRT-PCR and western blot. In addition, the tumorigenic risk of organs was assessed by long-term observation. Results: The POF mice model was successfully established by intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg/d for 10 days. Compared with POF group, two weeks after transplantation, serum FSH decreased, AMH and E2 increased in the P–H and P–U groups of mice (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the P–H and P–U groups (p > 0.05). In addition, the number of primary follicles, secondary follicles and antral follicles in both P–H and P–U groups were significantly increased (p < 0.05), while the atretic follicles was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The pups in POF group was significantly lower than that in P–H group and P–U group (p < 0. 01). Furthermore, those effects was more significant in P–H group than in P–U group (p < 0.05). In addition, the mitochondrial ultramicrostructure of the ovaries in the four groups showed a significant difference in the mitochondrial morphologies and number. In the POF group, the mitochondria presented a spheroids structure with fewer numbers, serious vacuolation and a disordered mitochondrial cristae arrangement. Nevertheless, after MSCs transplantation into the P–H and P–U group, we could observe ameliorative mitochondrial cristae alignment and vacuolation, as well as a small number of long rod-like structures. Mechanism study showed that KEAP1 protein expression was decreased in the P–H group, which increased the nuclear translocation of NRF2 and upregulated the expression of downstream HO-1 protein. At last, the possibility of tumor development after transplantation of HF-MSCs was excluded by long-term observation and organ anatomical examination. Conclusion: HF-MSCs can improve ovarian function in cyclophosphamide-induced POF mice, and the effects were superior to HU-MSCs. The underlying mechanism may by inhibiting ferroptosis of granulosa cells through KEAP1/NRF2/HO-1 pathway. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218443920

The quality of oocytes in PCOS patients remains poor, leading to poor pregnancy outcomes. The molecular mechanisms underlying the poor quality of oocytes in PCOS are not fully understood. This study aimed to explore the potential functional microRNAs (miRNAs) in follicular fluid (FF)-derived extracellular vesicles (FF-EVs) and their role in oocyte developmental competence in PCOS. We analyzed DEmiRNAs in FF-EVs and DEGs in oocytes from PCOS patients and controls using GEO database. We identified 14 potential functional DEmiRNAs in FF-EVs and predicted the target genes of 14 DEmiRNAs using TargetScan. We performed conjoint analyses between the target genes of these miRNAs and DEGs in oocytes, identifying 12 DEmiRNAs whose target genes overlap with oocyte DEGs. Thus, 12 functional DEmiRNAs were the hub miRNAs. These miRNAs were predicted to target genes involved in oocyte development and signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt, Ras, and MAPK pathways. KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that these miRNAs might impair oocyte developmental competence in PCOS by dysregulating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. qRT-PCR validated the increase of miR-93-3p and miR-152-3p, and the decrease of miR-625-5p and miR-17-5p in FF-EVs of PCOS patients. This study highlighted the significance of FF-EVs in the pathology of PCOS and revealed the potential role of the increase of miR-93-3p and miR-152-3p, and the decrease of miR-625-5p and miR-17-5p in impairing oocyte developmental competence in PCOS. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which these miRNAs affect oocyte development and to explore the potential therapeutic implications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218441218

The complex pathology of DACD remains unknown. Here, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to demonstrate unique cellular and molecular patterns of the hippocampus from a mouse model of diabetes. More in-depth analysis of oligodendrocytes (OLs) distinguished five subclusters, indicating different functional states of OLs and transcriptional changes in each subcluster. Based on the results of snRNA-seq and experiments in vivo, we observed demyelination and disharmony of oligodendroglial lineage cell composition in male diabetic mice. Serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) expression was significantly increased in the hippocampus OLs of male diabetic mice, and SGK1 knockdown in hippocampus reversed demyelination and DACD via N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1)-mediated pathway. The findings illustrated a transcriptional landscape of hippocampal OLs and substantiated impaired myelination in DACD. Our results provided direct evidence that inhibition of SGK1 or the promotion of myelination might be a potential therapeutic strategy for DACD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218440769

These disorders frequently present with abnormal responses from both B- and T-cells, which can have a significant impact on cardiovascular health, particularly among the female patients. Key mechanisms contributing to these diseases include the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome impaired efferocytosis is the process by which phagocytes clear apoptotic cells to maintain immune and developmental balance. Defects in this process can lead to inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. The gut microbiota helps defend against pathogens and signals immune cells, playing a vital role in human health and is involved in many aspects of the body. Novel therapeutic strategies such as nanomedicine and targeted treatments are being developed to restore immune balance. The significance of thymic homeostasis the influence of viral infections and the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures highlight the need for multidisciplinary approaches in the management of these conditions. A case study of a 9-year-old girl diagnosed with seronegative autoimmune encephalitis, who displayed severe obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and aggressive behavior, exemplifies the complexities involved in treatment. Promising interventions, including CAR-T-cell therapy and nanomedicine, are under development for various autoimmune diseases, such as vitiligo and refractory autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs).

Among these forces, electrostatic forces play a crucial role, working alongside van der Waals forces and oncotic pressure to maintain the retina’s attachment to the RPE and ensure the integrity of the blood-retina barrier (BRB). The composition of the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM), influenced by molecules like Retbindin secreted by rod photoreceptors, further modulates these forces, affecting processes like visual pigment regeneration and metabolite exchange. In the context of retinal tissue engineering and new technologies for support and cells-based treatments, electrostatic forces are harnessed to optimize nutrient supply to transplanted RPE cells by reducing pore size in electrospun polymer membranes. Scaffold-based strategies for retinal repair also utilize electrostatic, hydrophobic, van der Waals, and hydrogen bonding forces to enhance cell adhesion and growth, mimicking the basement membrane. Understanding the complex dynamics of these forces in retinal-RPE interactions holds promise for innovative treatments for retinal disorders, emphasizing the intricate balance between electrostatic forces, van der Waals forces, oncotic pressure, and more. These insights open exciting avenues for research and therapeutic interventions in ophthalmology. Additionally, van der Waals forces are explored in the context of cell adhesion, and their potential role in retinal health is discussed, particularly in relation to melanin’s protective properties against blue light-induced damage. Tissue engineering approaches, both scaffold-free and scaffold-based, are discussed, highlighting the importance of physical surface treatments and adhesive forces in preserving engineered RPE tissue.

However, the mechanism of AS-IV in glucocorticoid-induced osteoclastogenesis (GIO) remains undetermined. Herein, we examined the influence of AS-IV on GIO and bone loss. Methods: RAW264.7 cells were incubated with dexamethasone (Dex) alone or Dex and receptor activator of nuclear factor-B ligand (RANKL) (Dex and RANKL) for 2 days, and then treated with Dex or Dex and RANKL through AS-IV for the timeframes indicated. Following, mice were intraperitoneally administered with an intermediate-acting glucocorticoid, methylprednisolone (MP), or MP and AS-IV for 6 weeks. Results: AS-IV significantly decreased Dex-induced osteoclast nucleus and area, however, it did not impact the number of Dex-induced osteoclasts in RAW264.7 cells. AS-IV also significantly decreased the osteoclastic marker protein expressions in Dex-induced RAW264.7 cells with concentration of dose dependent fashion. Additionally, AS-IV promoted p38 phosphorylation (p-) and p-p65 translocation to the nucleus, while inhibiting phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (p-ERK) and inhibitor of Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (p-IκB) levels. However, the AS-IV-mediated action on p-MAPK, p-NF-κB, and osteoclastic marker expressions were reversed by MAPK or IκB inhibitor in Dex-induced RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, our in vivo evaluation revealed that AS-IV also attenuated the MP-mediated bone loss, and suppressed osteoclastogenesis. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that AS-IV inhibits GIO and attenuates bone loss via the MAPK/NF-κB pathway. This also suggested that AS-IV could be a potential promising therapeutic agent for glucocorticoid-triggered bone loss. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218424688

However, we do not yet have a clear understanding of the mechanisms by which MSCs exert their therapeutic effects in vivo. We found that the transplanted MSCs go an apoptotic fate within 24 h in vivo irrespective of the route of administration. Still, the short-term survival of MSCs do not affect their long-term therapeutic efficacy. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that transplantation of apoptotic MSCs (ApoMSCs) show similar or even better efficacy than viable MSCs, including a variety of preclinical disease models such as inflammatory diseases, skin damage, bone damage, organ damage, etc. Although the exact mechanism has yet to be explored, recent studies have shown that transplanted MSCs undergo apoptosis in vivo and are phagocytosed by phagocytes, thereby exerting immunomodulatory effects. The apoptotic extracellular vesicles secreted by ApoMSCs (MSC-ApoEVs) play a significant role in promoting immunomodulation, endogenous stem cell regeneration, and angiogenesis due to their apoptotic properties and inheritance of molecular characteristics from their parental MSCs. On this basis, this review aims to deeply explore the therapeutic applications and mechanisms of ApoMSCs and their secretion of MSC-ApoEVs, as well as the challenges they face. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218422580

Despite the advances in surgical and regenerative techniques, the result in most cases is the formation of a fibrocartilage repair tissue. Cell-based cartilage therapies are mainly focused on equine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (eBMSCs) as they are easily accessible, and multipotent. Nonetheless, alternative allogeneic sources, for example equine umbilical cord matrix mesenchymal stromal cells (eUCMSCs), hold promise given their non-invasive and readily accessible nature. Considerable research has been dedicated to exploring chondroinductive factors (e.g., peptides and small compounds), aiming to replace growth factors for inducing chondrogenesis. However, these factors have not yet translated to the equine community. Therefore, in the current study, we selected from the literature two promising peptides, CM10 and CK2.1, and two promising compounds, kartogenin and SM04690, and assessed their chondroinductive potential with both eBMSCs and eUCMSCs. In addition, the chondroinductive potential of eBMSCs was evaluated in monolayer and spheroid culture in both hypoxia and normoxia in response to dexamethasone and/or transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-β3). Results: Following 21 days of culture, none of the evaluated chondrogenic factors resulted in a higher gene expression of chondrogenic markers compared to the positive or negative controls with eBMSCs or eUCMSCs. Interestingly, spheroid culture in hypoxia with dexamethasone treatment (without TGF-β or any compound or peptide) was sufficient to induce the chondrogenic differentiation of eBMSCs. Conclusion: Based on cell response to the positive control, in the conditions employed in the current study, eBMSCs may be preferred over eUCMSCs for chondrogenesis. The current study supports the use of spheroid culture, and the use of dexamethasone over TGF-β or any of the compounds or peptides tested here from the prior literature to drive chondrogenesis with eBMSCs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218419949

Studying the abnormal characteristics of PCD pathway-related molecular markers can provide a basis for prognosis prediction and targeted drug design in AML patients. Methods: A total of 1394 genes representing 13 different PCD pathways were examined in AML patients and healthy donors. The upregulated genes were analyzed for their ability to predict overall survival (OS) individually, and these prognostic genes were subsequently combined to construct a PCD-related prognostic signature via an integrated approach consisting of 101 models based on ten machine learning algorithms. RNA transcriptome and clinical data from multiple AML cohorts (TCGA-AML, GSE106291, GSE146173 and Beat AML) were obtained to develop and validate the AML prognostic model. Results: A total of 214 upregulated PCD-related genes were identified in AML patients, 39 of which were proven to be prognostic genes in the training cohort. On the basis of the average C-index and number of model genes identified from the machine learning combinations, a PCD index was developed and validated for predicting AML OS. A prognostic nomogram was then generated and validated on the basis of the PCD index, age and ELN risk stratification in the Beat AML cohort and the GSE146173 cohort, revealing satisfactory predictive power (AUC values ≥ 0.7). With different mutation patterns, a higher PCD index was associated with a worse OS. The PCD index was significantly related to higher scores for immunosuppressive cells and mature leukemia cell subtypes. As the gene most closely related to the PCD index, the expression of SMAD3 was further validated in vitro. AML cells harboring KMT2A rearrangements were more sensitive to the SMAD3 inhibitor SIS3, and the expression of the autophagy-related molecular marker LC3 was increased in KMT2A-rearranged cell lines after SIS3 monotherapy and combined treatment. Conclusion: The PCD index and SMAD3 gene expression levels have potential prognostic value and can be used in targeted therapy for AML, and these findings can lead to the development of effective strategies for the combined treatment of high-risk AML patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218419424

We developed the metal-organic frameworks as hair follicle-targeted delivery system (SA-MOF), stearic acid (SA) was used to modify metal-organic frameworks to form a protective hydrophobic layer on the surface and provide the additional hair growth-promoting effect. Cardamonin (CAR), a newly discovered biosafety natural product, was encapsulated in SA-MOF (CAR@SA-MOF) to promote the therapeutic efficacy on AGA. CD-MOF surface-engineered nanoparticles modified by SA avoided the rapid hydration and disintegration of CD-MOF in water, which improved the drug release and follicular deposition of drug.

Investigating the mechanisms of metabolic adaptation during disease progression has become a central focus of research. Considering that impaired glucose metabolism is closely related to decreased insulin signaling and insulin resistance, a new concept ""type 3 diabetes mellitus (T3DM)"" has been coined. T3DM specifically refers to the brain’s neurons becoming unresponsive to insulin, underscoring the strong link between diabetes and AD. Recent studies reveal that during brain insulin resistance, neurons exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced glucose metabolism, and elevated lactate levels. These findings suggest that impaired insulin signaling caused by T3DM may lead to a compensatory metabolic shift in neurons toward glycolysis. Consequently, this review aims to explore the underlying causes of T3DM and elucidate how insulin resistance drives metabolic reprogramming in neurons during AD progression. Additionally, it highlights therapeutic strategies targeting insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function as promising avenues for the successful development of AD treatments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218415001

Brain aging is a complex process involving multiple mechanisms, including oxidative stress, apoptosis of damaged neuronal cells, chronic inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, and research into new therapeutic strategies to delay brain aging has gradually become a research focus in recent years. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in cell therapy due to their functions such as antioxidative stress, anti-inflammation, and tissue regeneration. However, accompanying safety issues such as immune rejection, tumor development, and pulmonary embolism cannot be avoided. Studies have shown that using exosome derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-Exo) for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is a safe and effective method. It not only has the therapeutic effects of stem cells but also avoids the risks associated with cell therapy. Therefore, exploring new therapeutic strategies to delay normal brain aging from the mechanism of MSC-Exo in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is feasible.

While the role of Karyopherin a2 (KPNA2) in promoting BCa growth is established, the precise mechanism remains elusive. Methods: To investigate the regulatory role of KPNA2 in BCa, we employed a comprehensive approach integrating clinical case data and bioinformatics analysis to evaluate the expression of KPNA2 in BCa tissues. Mechanisms promoting cancer by KPNA2 were examined using both in vivo and in vitro models. Results: Our research reveals that miR-26b-5p acts as an anticancer factor by targeting and inhibiting KPNA2 expression. Furthermore, we have observed that the interaction between KPNA2 and Kinesin Family Member C1 (KIFC1) facilitates the transition of BCa cells into the G2/M phase, thereby promoting tumor advancement via activation of the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)- Protein Kinase B (AKT) pathway. Importantly, this investigation is the first to identify KPNA2 expression in exosomes originating from BCa tissues. Plasma exosomes from patients with BCa exhibited notably increased levels of KPNA2 compared with healthy controls, suggesting KPNA2 as a potential new tumor indicator. Additionally, KPNA2 from BCa cells triggered the conversion of fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which secreted elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), contributing to a tumor-supporting environment. Conclusions: These findings suggest that KPNA2 is a key gene that promotes BCa progression, can potentially be a novel tumor marker, and may serve as a new therapeutic target for BCa. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218409052

The purpose of this study was to investigate the competitive endogenous RNA mechanism involved in the senescence of NPMSCs induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). Methods: Bioinformatic analysis identified differentially expressed circRNAs. Interactions among circSPG21, miR-217, and the NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) were validated through dual-luciferase assays, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA immune precipitation. β-Gal staining, EdU staining, Western blotting, JC-1 assays, cell cycle analysis, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT‒qPCR) were used to examine the functions of these molecules in TBHP-induced senescent NPMSCs. The therapeutic effects of circSPG21 were evaluated in a rat IVDD model. Results: CircSPG21 expression was significantly decreased in both human and rat IVDD tissues, whereas miR-217 was upregulated and SIRT1 was downregulated. Overexpression of circSPG21 alleviated NPMSC senescence by reducing P21 and P53 levels and restoring mitophagy through Parkin. The protective effects of circSPG21 were mediated through the miR-217/SIRT1 axis, as SIRT1 knockdown attenuated these benefits. CircSPG21 also ameliorated disc degeneration in the IVDD rat model, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

Endogenous cell recruitment and osteogenic differentiation are two sequential stages in bone regeneration, and disruptions in these two processes present significant obstacles to senescent bone repair. To address these issues, engineered extracellular vesicles (EV) with sequential stem cell recruitment and osteogenic functions were developed. This study demonstrated that Apt19s-engineered extracellular vesicles (Apt19s-EV) recognize and recruit bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells derived from old rats (O-BMSCs) specifically and effectively. MiR-376b-5p, identified by RNA sequencing and transfection, was significantly decreased in O-BMSCs, and it was selected to construct miR-376b-5p-engineered extracellular vesicles (376b-EV). 376b-EV could promote osteogenesis and alleviate senescence of O-BMSCs by targeting Camsap1. To combine the advantages of Apt19s and miR-376b-5p, dual engineered extracellular vesicles (Apt-376b-EV) comprising both Apt19s and miR-376b-5p modifications were constructed. To further validate its function, Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel was used as a carrier to construct the Apt-376b-EV@GelMA delivery system. The in vitro results have demonstrated that Apt-376b-EV@GelMA could recruit O-BMSCs, alleviate senescence and promote osteogenic differentiation sequentially. Notably, the in vivo study also showed that Apt-376b-EV@GelMA could sequentially recruit endogenous stem cells and enhance new bone formation in senescent bone fracture and critical-sized defect models. In summary, the dual engineered extracellular vesicles, Apt-376b-EV, offer an appealing solution for recruiting endogenous stem cells and promoting bone repair sequentially in the senescent microenvironment, which may broaden the clinical applications of engineered EV and provide valuable strategies for treating senescent bone-related diseases in the future clinical work. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218352522

These structures participate in various physiological and pathological processes and are considered promising candidates as disease markers, therapeutic reagents, and drug carriers. Both H. pylori and the host epithelial cells infected by H. pylori secrete EVs, which contribute to inflammation and the development of disease phenotypes. However, many aspects of the cellular and molecular biology of EV functions remain incompletely understood due to methodological challenges in studying these small structures. This review also highlights the roles of EVs derived from H. pylori-infected cells in the pathogenesis of gastric and extragastric diseases. Understanding the specific functions of these EVs during H. pylori infections, whether are advantageous to the host or the pathogen, may help the development new therapeutic approaches to prevent disease. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218338382

Anti-cancer treatments are often unsuccessful, and single-cell technologies to rein drug resistance mechanisms are still fruitless. The National Cancer Institute defines aggressive cancers at the tissue level, describing them as those that spread rapidly, despite severe treatment. At the molecular, foundational level, the quantitative biophysics discipline defines aggressive cancers as harboring a large number of (overexpressed, or mutated) crucial signaling proteins in major proliferation pathways populating their active conformations, primed for their signal transduction roles. This comprehensive review explores highly aggressive cancers on the foundational and cell signaling levels, focusing on the differences between highly aggressive cancers and the more treatable ones. It showcases aggressive tumors as harboring massive, cancer-promoting, catalysis-primed oncogenic proteins, especially through certain overexpression scenarios, as predisposed aggressive tumor candidates. Our examples narrate strong activation of ERK1/2, and other oncogenic proteins, through malfunctioning chromatin and crosslinked signaling, and how they activate multiple proliferation pathways. They show the increased cancer heterogeneity, plasticity, and drug resistance. Our review formulates the principles underlying cancer aggressiveness on the molecular level, discusses scenarios, and describes drug regimen (single drugs and drug combinations) for PDAC, NSCLC, CRC, HCC, breast and prostate cancers, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, and leukemia as examples. All show overexpression scenarios of master transcription factors, transcription factors with gene fusions, copy number alterations, dysregulation of the epigenetic codes and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions in aggressive tumors, as well as high mutation loads of vital upstream signaling regulators, such as EGFR, c-MET, and K-Ras, befitting these principles. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218337236

These modes are assumed to be driven by mutually exclusive actin cytoskeletal organizations, which are either lamellar (flat, branched network) or cortical (crosslinked to the plasma membrane). Here we exploit Drosophila macrophage (hemocyte) developmental dispersal to reveal that these cells maintain both a lamellar actin network at their cell front and a cortical actin network at the rear. Loss of classical actin cortex regulators, such as Moesin, perturb hemocyte morphology and cell migration. Furthermore, cortical and lamellipodial actin networks are interregulated. Upon phosphorylation and binding to the plasma membrane, Moesin is advected to the rear by lamellar actin flow. Simultaneously, the cortical actin network feeds back on the lamella to help regulate actin flow speed and leading-edge dynamics. These data reveal that hemocyte motility requires both lamellipodial and cortical actin architectures in homeostatic equilibrium. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218275701

This study aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and/or placental extracts (PE) in ameliorating POI induced by cyclophosphamide, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent. Materials and methods: Thirty-five 8–10 weeks and weight 200 ± 20 g female albino Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were evenly distributed into five groups: negative control (Group 1), positive control cyclophosphamide (CPA) (Group 2), stem cell therapy (CPA+MSCs) (Group 3), placental extract therapy (CPA+PE) (Group 4), and combination therapy (CPA+MSCs+PE) (Group 5). Rats in the CPA group received intraperitoneal (IP) cyclophosphamide injection (50 mg/kg), followed by daily (8 mg/kg) cyclophosphamide injection (14 days). Subsequently, the rats received 1 × 106 MSCs via intravenous administration and/or 50 µL of PE, followed by sacrifice after 4 weeks. Flow cytometry was used to identify MSCs. Hormone levels (FSH, LH, E<inf>2</inf>, and progesterone) were assessed using ELISA, and primordial follicles were quantified to evaluate primordial follicle reserves. Ovarian structure was histomorphologically evaluated, and PCNA immunohistochemistry was conducted. Morphometric measurements and statistical analyses were performed. Results: Hormonal measurements revealed a decrease in E2 and progesterone levels, accompanied by an increase in FSH levels following cyclophosphamide treatment. However, after BM-MSC therapy, hormonal levels nearly returned to normal. In addition to BM-MSC therapy, PE treatment was also evaluated. PE administration resulted in partial restoration of hormonal balance, showing a mild increase in E2 and progesterone levels, with a slight reduction in FSH levels compared to the cyclophosphamide-treated group. Histological examination revealed that cyclophosphamide caused significant loss of primordial follicles, stromal blood vessel damage, and substantial fibrosis. Interestingly, combination of MSCs and PE treatment showed some ameliorative effects on ovarian histology, with reduced fibrosis and slight preservation of ovarian follicles, although these changes were less pronounced than those observed with BM-MSC therapy alone. Conclusion: MSCs therapy was more effective in restoring ovarian folliculogenesis, whereas combination with PE provided moderate protection against the histological and immunohistochemical alterations induced by cyclophosphamide. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218265062

Existing research has extracted a bright red fluid called cell-free fat extract from human adipose tissue, which may play an important role in delaying the progression of osteoarthritis. By comparing with intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of intra-articular injection of CEFFE on both clinical efficacy and the reduction of bone marrow edema in patients with early to mid-stage knee osteoarthritis. Methods: A total of 48 patients with KOA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade II-III) symptoms were randomly divided into CEFFE group (24 cases) and HA group (24 cases). The patients in the CEFFE group received five injections of CEFFE (2 ml, 1 time/week), and the patients in the HA group received five injections of HA (2 ml, 1 ml/10 mg, 1 time/week). All the patients underwent clinical assessments using rating scales, including VAS, WOMAC and Lysholm Knee Score. These assessments were conducted at pre-treatment and at 3-week, 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up timepoints post-treatment. The clinical efficacy was evaluated at the 6-month follow-up after the treatment. The changes in subchondral bone marrow edema before and 6 months after treatment were assessed by grading BME on MRI of the affected knees. Results: A total of 52 knees from 46 patients were included in the final analysis. Comparison of VAS score, WOMAC score, and Lysholm score between the two groups revealed that the differences between pre-treatment and 3 weeks post-treatment were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). For the VAS score and WOMAC score at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post-treatment, the CEFFE group was lower than the HA group (P < 0.05). For the Lysholm score, the CEFFE group was higher than the HA group (P < 0.05). Compared with pre-treatment, VAS scores and WOMAC scores were lower and Lysholm scores were higher at all post-treatment time points (P < 0.05). At 6 months post-treatment, the clinical efficacy of the CEFFE group was significantly better than that of the HA group (P < 0.05). At 6 months post-treatment, MRI grading showed that subchondral BME was reduced to different degrees in both groups, with the reduction being more pronounced in the CEFFE group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that intra-articular injection of CEFFE into the knee joint could enhance the durability of tissue-specific cells (especially chondrocytes) and improve cellular metabolic processes, preventing the continued progression of osteoarthritis. Both CEFFE and HA were found to improve clinical symptoms and reduced subchondral bone marrow edema in the treatment of early to mid-stage knee osteoarthritis. However, CEFFE was more effective than HA in achieving these outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218261464

This article explores the impact of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) on the hypermethylation of key tumor suppressor genes, and some histone modifications in primary brain tumor (PBT) patients. This study involved 73 patients diagnosed with PBT and 15 non-cancerous brain tissue samples as contol. DNA extracted from tumor specimens was used to evaluate the methylation status of tumor suppressor genes, P16 and RRP22, using the methylation-specific PCR (MSP) technique and four histone marks (H4K16ac, H3K9ac, H4K20me3, and H3k4me2) to investigate by western blotting. The results of MSP revealed the methylation of RRP22 and P16 promoter regions and western blot analysis demonstrated significantly low levels of H3K9ac, H4K20me3, and H3K4me2 in PBT patients in comparison with the controls. The results of regression analysis revealed direct and significant correlations between serum OCPs concentration and methylation of RRP22 and P16. Furthermore, a direct and significant association was observed between hypomethylation of histones H3K4 and H4K20, as well as hypoacetylation of H3K9, with OCPs levels.

As a key component of the innate immune system, macrophages play a vital role in SALI, in which a macrophage phenotype imbalance caused by an increase in M1 macrophages or a decrease in M2 macrophages is common. Despite significant advances in SALI research, effective drug therapies are still lacking. Therefore, the development of new treatments for SALI is urgently needed. An increasing number of studies suggest that natural products (NPs) can alleviate SALI by modulating macrophage polarization through various targets and pathways. This review examines the regulatory mechanisms of macrophage polarization and their involvement in the progression of SALI. It highlights how NPs mitigate macrophage imbalances to alleviate SALI, focusing on key signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT, TLR4/NF-κB, JAK/STAT, IRF, HIF, NRF2, HMGB1, TREM2, PKM2, and exosome-mediated signaling. NPs influencing macrophage polarization are classified into five groups: terpenoids, polyphenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, and others.

A key hallmark of AD is the irreversible overaccumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain, associated with neuroinflammation and neuronal death. Although Aβ clearance and immunoregulation have been the major therapeutic strategies for AD, highly selective transport across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) negatively affects the delivery efficacy of the drugs without the ability to cross the BBB. In this review, we discuss the potential of lipid-based nanoparticles (LBNs) as promising vehicles for drug delivery in AD treatment. LBNs, composed of phospholipid mono- or bilayer, have attracted attention due to their exceptional cellular penetration capabilities and drug loading capabilities, which also facilitate cargo transcytosis across the BBB. Recent advances in the development and engineering of LBNs overcome the existing limitations of the current clinical approaches for AD treatment by addressing off-target effects and low therapeutic efficacy. Here, we review the transport pathways across the BBB, as well as various types of LBNs for AD therapy, including exosomes, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), to elucidate their distinctive properties, preparation methodologies, and therapeutic efficacy, thereby offering innovative avenues for novel drug development for clinical translation in AD therapy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218251530

The adverse tumor microenvironment also selects for increased malignancy. Mitochondria are integral in stress sensing to allow for tumor cells to adapt to stressful conditions. Here, we show that colorectal cancer cells adapted to acidic microenvironment (CRC-AA) are more reliant on oxidative phosphorylation than their parental cells, and the acetyl-CoA in CRC-AA cells are generated from fatty acids and glutamine, but not from glucose. Consistently, CRC-AA cells exhibit increased mitochondrial mass and fitness that depends on an upregulated autophagic flux-lipid droplet axis. Lipid droplets (LDs) function as a buffering system to store the fatty acids derived from autophagy and to protect mitochondria from lipotoxicity in CRC-AA cells. Blockade of LD biogenesis causes mitochondrial dysfunction that can be rescued by inhibiting carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 α (CPT1α). High level of mitochondrial superoxide is essential for the AMPK activation, resistance to apoptosis, high autophagic flux and mitochondrial function in CRC-AA cells. Thus, our results demonstrate that the cascade of autophagic flux and LD formation plays an essential role in sustaining mitochondrial fitness to promote cancer cell survival under chronic acidosis. Our findings provide insight into the pro-survival metabolic plasticity in cancer cells under microenvironmental or therapeutic stress and imply that this pro-survival cascade may potentially be targeted in cancer therapy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218250992

These fractures, often undiagnosed, can lead to severe health consequences and are influenced by bone mineral density and abnormal loads. Management strategies range from non-surgical interventions to surgical treatments. Moreover, the interaction between immune cells and bone cells plays a crucial role in bone repair processes, highlighting the importance of osteoimmunology in understanding and treating bone pathologies. Methods: This study aims to investigate the xCell signature-based immune cell profiles in osteoporotic patients with and without vertebral fractures, utilizing advanced predictive modeling through the XGBoost algorithm. Results: Our findings reveal an increased presence of CD4 + naïve T cells and central memory T cells in VF patients, indicating distinct adaptive immune responses. The XGBoost model identified Th1 cells, CD4 memory T cells, and hematopoietic stem cells as key predictors of VF. Notably, VF patients exhibited a reduction in Th1 cells and an enrichment of Th17 cells, which promote osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. Gene expression analysis further highlighted an upregulation of osteoclast-related genes and a downregulation of osteoblast-related genes in VF patients, emphasizing the disrupted balance between bone formation and resorption.

In this study, we introduce an optimized protocol for the 3D analysis of skeletal tissues, enabling the visualization of hematopoietic and stromal cells, especially LepR+ stromal cells, within optically cleared bone hemisections. Our method preserves the 3D tissue architecture and is extendable to other hematopoietic sites such as calvaria and vertebrae.

The bone hemisections are compatible with diverse antibody labeling strategies. Confocal microscopy of these transparent samples allows for qualitative and quantitative image analysis using Aivia or Bitplane Imaris software, assessing a spectrum of parameters.

This study investigates the combined effects of gibberellin and vermiwash treatment on the life history and antioxidant system of P. absoluta. Given the pest’s resistance to many chemical pesticides, alternative control methods are crucial. Gibberellins are plant growth hormones known for their role in plant development and stress responses, while vermiwash is a bio-fertilizer rich in nutrients and microbial agents. We applied gibberellin and vermiwash (GV treatment) to tomato plants and assessed the impact on P. absoluta developmental stages, reproduction, and enzymatic activities. Our results show significant differences in larval development times (32.06 ± 0.39) and survival rates (0.53 ± 0.09) between treated and control groups (27.38 ± 0.35 and 0.80 ± 0.07, respectively). The GV treatment prolonged the total lifespan of P. absoluta (44.31 ± 0.51) but reduced its intrinsic rate of increase (r) (0.086 ± 0.009) and finite rate of increase (λ) (1.090 ± 0.009). Enzymatic assays revealed altered antioxidant and detoxifying enzyme activities in treated larvae.

Interactions among these cells markedly affect the glucoregulatory functions of islets along with the surrounding niche and pancreatic tissue-specific geometrical organization. However, stem cell (SC)-derived islets generated in vitro often lack the three-dimensional extracellular microenvironment and peri-vasculature, which leads to the immaturity of SC-derived islets, reducing their ability to detect glucose fluctuations and insulin release. Here, we bioengineer the in vivo-like pancreatic niches by optimizing the combination of pancreatic tissue-specific extracellular matrix and basement membrane proteins and utilizing bioprinting-based geometrical guidance to recreate the spatial pattern of islet peripheries. The bioprinted islet-specific niche promotes coordinated interactions between islets and vasculature, supporting structural and functional features resembling native islets. Our strategy not only improves SC-derived islet functionality but also offers significant potential for advancing research on islet development, maturation, and diabetic disease modeling, with future implications for translational applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218237401

Materials and methods: The expression of DDIT4 at the mRNA level and its potential role as a prognostic biomarker in gliomas were analyzed using the GEPIA tool. To validate these findings, DDIT4 protein expression levels and their prognostic significance were examined in tissue microarrays from glioma patients using immunohistochemistry in clinical samples. Results: Bioinformatics analysis revealed that DDIT4 overexpression in glioma tumors and its high mRNA expression levels are associated with poor outcomes, likely through mTOR signaling. At the protein level, positive nuclear DDIT4 expression was linked to higher histological grades and temozolomide treatment. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis demonstrated that positive nuclear DDIT4 expression is a significant predictor of poor disease-specific survival (DSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Additionally, nuclear DDIT4 expression was identified as an independent prognostic factor for DSS. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that nuclear DDIT4 expression may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in glioma patients. However, further studies with larger sample sizes and long-term follow-ups are needed to validate these observations and confirm their clinical relevance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218234149

The gut microbiota is linked to T2DM. Recent studies have showed that the metabolism of gut microbiota can trigger T2DM. Low dose radiation (LDR) has been proved to activate various protective bioeffects on diabetes. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: In this study, T2DM model was established using high fat diet combined with streptozocin (STZ) injection in C57BL/6 mice, and then exposed to multiple 75 mGy LDR every other day for one month. The changes of blood glucose levels, body weight, and the damage of pancreas were measured. In addition, 16 S rDNA amplicon sequencing was used to detect gut microbiota alteration. Metabolic profiling was carried out using the liquid mass spectrometry system, followed by the combinative analysis of gut microbiota alteration. Furthermore, the inflammatory factors and related pathways were detected. Results: We found that LDR attenuate blood glucose levels and the weights of body in T2DM mice, and reduce pancreas impairment. In addition, in the gut, LDR regulated the relative abundance of Bacilli, Desulfobacterota, Verrucomicrobiota, and Proteobacteria. The non-target metabolomics analysis found that LDR significantly improve the metabolic abnormalities in T2DM, which is closely related to the gut microbiota abundance. Furthermore, the inflammatory effects activated by TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathways in T2DM were ameliorated by LDR. Conclusion: These results suggest that LDR may exert a beneficial role in T2DM by modulating gut microbiota and metabolites, especially in TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218231778

First, we revealed that CTSK lineage TDMSCs are the major source of osteoblasts and fibroblasts in HO and are responsive to mechanical cues via single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and experiments with a lineage tracing mouse model. Moreover, we showed that PC1 mediates the mechanosignal transduction of CTSK lineage TDMSCs to regulate osteogenic and fibrogenic differentiation and alters the ECM architecture by facilitating TAZ nuclear translocation. Conditional gene depletion of Pkd1 or Taz in CTSK lineage cells and pharmaceutical intervention in the PC1-TAZ axis disrupt osteogenesis, fibrogenesis and ECM organization, and consequently attenuate HO progression. These findings suggest that mechanically sensitive CTSK-lineage TDMSCs contribute to heterotopic ossification through PC1-TAZ signaling axis mediated cell fate determination and ECM organization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218213564

Therein, the conducted work goes toward ascertaining the role of the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes (BMSCs-Exos)/miR-142-3p/GFI1 axis in glioma development. Methods: Cancer tissues from patients with glioma and normal brain tissues from those who underwent surgery for traumatic brain injury were collected. miR-142-3p and GFI1 expression in tissues and cells were measured. Exos derived from BMSCs carrying miR-142-3p were cocultured with glioma cells to observe the effects of exosomal miR-142-3p on glioma cell invasion, migration, and apoptosis. The targeting relationship of miR-142-3p and GFI1 was validated. A series of rescue assays were conducted to further investigate whether GFI1 is implicated in the exosomal miR-142-3p-mediated regulation of glioma cell invasion, migration, and apoptosis. Results: miR-142-3p was low-expressed in glioma tissues and cells, and the low expression had an association with unwanted prognosis. Exos-shuttled miR-142-3p suppressed the migration and invasion, while promoting apoptosis of glioma cells. Further investigation revealed that GFI1 was a direct target of miR-142-3p, and re-expression of GFI1 neutralized the inhibitory effects of exosomal miR-142-3p. Conclusion: Exosomal miR-142-3p suppressed glioma cell migration and invasion and stimulated apoptosis by targeting GFI1. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218212533

Exercise has been shown to have protective effects on renal function, yet the impact of varying exercise intensities on lithium-induced nephropathy is not well understood. Aim: This study aimed to investigate the effects of different intensities of endurance training on kidney function and inflammation in a rat model of lithium-induced nephropathy, focusing on the expression of aquaporin 2 (AQP2), glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK-3β), and SIRT1. Methods: Thirty-five male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: control, lithium-only, lithium with low-intensity exercise (LIT), lithium with medium-intensity exercise (MIT), and lithium with high-intensity exercise (HIT). The lithium-induced nephropathy model was established by administering lithium in food. Exercise groups underwent treadmill training at specified intensities for eight weeks. Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) was measured, and GFR was evaluated by Cr clearance. ELISA and Western blotting assessed inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-10), SIRT1, GSK-3β, and AQP2 expressions in kidney tissues. Results: Lithium significantly reduced Cr clearance and increased FENa compared to controls. All exercise intensities improved Cr clearance and reduced FENa, with HIT showing the most significant improvement. Exercise at all intensities reduced TNF-α levels and increased IL-10 levels, with MIT and HIT significantly enhancing SIRT1 levels. Lithium reduced the expression of GSK-3β and AQP2, whereas exercise increased their expression across all intensities. Conclusion: Endurance training, particularly at high intensity, significantly mitigates lithium-induced renal impairment by improving GFR, reducing inflammation, and enhancing the expression of renal protective proteins. These findings suggest that tailored exercise regimens could be beneficial for patients undergoing long-term lithium therapy to prevent renal damage.

This study, based on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), aims to explore the changes in H-type vasculature endothelial cells (H_ECs) in osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) and hip osteoarthritis (HOA), focusing on the death modes such as ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and parthanatos. Methods: We re-analyzed the scRNA-seq data of femoral head samples publicly available in 2022. This study selected nine femoral head samples (3 each from HOA, ONFH stage 3 A, and ONFH stage 4). CD31 + EMCN + endothelial cells were classified as H_ECs. Molecular differences were assessed using Gene Ontology and KEGG analysis. Hypoxia, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and parthanatos indices were calculated, and transcription factors were predicted using SENIC. Cell communication was analyzed with CellChat. Results: After integrating the 9 samples, 14 cell types were identified: B cells, Mesenchymal stem cells, Osteoblasts, Endothelial cells, Monocytes, T cells, NK cells, Fibroblasts, Macrophages, Common myeloid progenitors, Chondrocytes, Myelocytes, Osteoclasts, and Pericytes. The number of endothelial cells and H_ECs decreased with necrosis severity. H_ECs showed higher angiogenic capacity but lower stress resistance compared to other endothelial cells. Angiogenic capacity decreased in necrotic samples, accompanied by an elevation in inflammation levels. The hypoxia index was higher, with ferroptosis increased in stage 3 A and parthanatos in stages 3 A and 4. No change was observed in pyroptosis. Cell communication analysis revealed downregulation of SLIT3-ROBO4 signaling during necrosis. Conclusion: H_ECs show molecular differences compared to other endothelial cells. Ferroptosis and parthanatos contribute to the demise of H_ECs in ONFH, with pericytes and fibroblasts supporting H_EC angiogenesis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218211477

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of exosomes from MSCs stimulated with plasma from patients with liver failure (LF-Exos). Methods: Untreated exosomes (NC-Exos) and LF-Exos were extracted and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), western blotting, and miRNA sequencing. We then examined the protective effects of LF-Exos on hepatocytes acutely injured by D-galactosamine (D-GalN)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) co-treatment and on a mouse model of acute liver failure (ALF). Apoptosis was assessed using the CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. Liver tissue damage was examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. The levels of signaling pathway proteins were determined by western blotting. Results: Stimulation with plasma from patients with liver failure significantly altered the morphology of MSCs and reduced their proliferative activity. Gene chip analysis identified 31 differentially expressed miRNAs, and further analysis showed that these differentially expressed miRNAs may affect the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Compared to NC-Exos, LF-Exos induced AKT phosphorylation in hepatocytes and liver tissues, inhibited D-GalN/LPS-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes, and reduced pathological liver injury in the mouse model of ALF. Conclusion: The biological effects of Exos were improved after stimulation with plasma from patients with liver failure. LF-Exos may inhibit the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome and activate the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway to exert protective effects on acutely injured hepatocytes and a mouse model of ALF. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218211213

This study unveils a novel mechanistic insight into scar formation by examining the differential expression of Homeobox (HOX) genes in response to mechanical forces in fibroblasts derived from normal skin, hypertrophic scars, and keloids. Methods: We isolated fibroblasts from different scar types and conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify differential gene expression patterns among the fibroblasts. Computational modeling provided insight into tension alterations following injury, and these findings were complemented by in vitro experiments where fibroblasts were subjected to exogenous tensile stress to investigate the link between mechanical tension and cellular behavior. Results: Our study revealed differential HOX gene expression among fibroblasts derived from normal skin, hypertrophic scars, and keloids. Computational simulations predicted injury-induced tension reduction in the skin, and in vitro experiments revealed a negative correlation between tension and fibroblast proliferation. Importantly, we discovered that applying mechanical tension to fibroblasts can modulate HOX gene expression, suggesting a pivotal role of mechanical cues in scar formation and wound healing. Conclusion: This study proposes a model wherein successful wound healing and scar formation are critically dependent on maintaining tensional homeostasis in the skin, mediated by tension-sensitive HOX genes. Our findings highlight the potential of targeting mechanotransduction pathways and tension-sensitive HOX gene expression as therapeutic strategies for abnormal scar prevention and treatment, offering a new perspective on the complex process of scar formation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218211154

However, the mechanistic understandings of stem cell senescence and the potential strategies to counteract it remain elusive. Here, we reveal that the aging bone microenvironment impairs the Golgi apparatus thus diminishing mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) function and regeneration. Interestingly, replenishment of cell aggregates-derived extracellular vesicles (CA-EVs) rescues Golgi dysfunction and empowers senescent MSCs through the Golgi regulatory protein Syntaxin 5. Importantly, in vivo administration of CA-EVs significantly enhanced the bone defect repair rate and improved bone mass in aging mice, suggesting their therapeutic value for treating age-related osteoporosis and promoting bone regeneration. Collectively, our findings provide insights into Golgi regulation in stem cell senescence and bone aging, which further highlight CA-EVs as a potential rejuvenative approach for aging bone regeneration. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218210597

The mouse is a widely used model for studying human tissues and diseases, including dental pulp tissues. While human and mouse molars share many similarities, mouse incisors differ significantly from human teeth due to their continuous growth throughout their lifespan. The application of findings from mouse teeth to human disease remains insufficiently explored. Methods: Leveraging multiple single-cell datasets, we constructed a comprehensive dental pulp cell landscape to delineate tissue similarities and species-specific differences between humans and mice. Results: We identified a distinct cell population, Sfrp2hi fibroblast progenitors, found exclusively in mouse incisors and the developing tooth root of human molars. These cells play a crucial role in sustaining continuous tissue growth. Mechanistically, we found that the transcription factor Twist1, regulated via MAPK phosphorylation, binds to the Sfrp2 promoter and modulates Wnt signaling activation to maintain stem cell identity. Conclusions: Our study reveals a previously unrecognized subset of dental mesenchymal stem cells critical for tooth growth.

Osteoporosis is a significant global health issue, and the current treatment options are highly restricted. Transplanting genetically engineered MSCs has been acknowledged as a highly promising therapy for osteoporosis. We utilized a random walk-based technique to discern genes associated with ossification. The osteogenic value of these genes was assessed on the basis of information found in published scientific literature. GO enrichment analysis of these genes was performed to determine if they were enriched in any certain function. Immunohistochemical and western blot techniques were used to identify and measure protein expression. The expression of genes involved in osteogenic differentiation was examined via qRT‒PCR. Lentiviral transfection was utilized to suppress the expression of the FOXA1 gene in hBMSCs. An in vivo mouse model of ovariectomy was created, and radiographic examination was conducted to confirm the impact of FOXA1 knockdown on osteoporosis. The osteogenic score of each gene was calculated by assessing its similarity to osteo-specific genes. The majority of the genes with the highest rankings were linked with osteogenic differentiation, indicating that our approach is useful for identifying genes associated with ossification. GO enrichment analysis revealed that these pathways are enriched primarily in bone-related processes. FOXA1 is a crucial transcription factor that controls the process of osteogenic differentiation, as indicated by similarity analysis. FOXA1 was significantly increased in those with osteoporosis. Downregulation of FOXA1 markedly augmented the expression of osteoblast-specific genes and proteins, activated the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, intensified ALP activity, and promoted mineral deposition. In addition, excessive expression of FOXA1 significantly reduced ALP activity and mineral deposits. Using a mouse model in which the ovaries were surgically removed, researchers reported that suppressing the FOXA1 gene in bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) prevented the loss of bone density caused by ovariectomy. This finding was confirmed by analyzing the bone structure via micro-CT. Furthermore, our approach can distinguish genes that exhibit osteogenic differentiation characteristics. This ability can aid in the identification of novel genes associated with osteogenic differentiation, which can be utilized in the treatment of osteoporosis. Computational and laboratory evidence indicates that reducing the expression of FOXA1 enhances the process of bone formation in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and may serve as a promising approach to prevent osteoporosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218204613

Betaine has been confirmed to modulate the multidirectional differentiation of MSCs, while its effect on chondrogenic differentiation of Stem Cells from the Apical Papilla (SCAPs) is unknown. Here, we explored the effects and underlying mechanisms of betaine on chondrogenic differentiation of SCAPs. Methods: Betaine was added for SCAPs chondrogenic induction. The chondrogenic differentiation potential was assessed using Alcian Blue staining, Sirius Red staining and the main chondrogenic markers. In vivo cartilage regeneration effects were evaluated by the rat TMJOA model. RNA-sequencing and biological analyses were performed to select target genes and biological processes involved. The mechanism betaine acts on chondrogenic differentiation of SCAPs was further explored. Results: Betain-treated SCAPs demonstrated stronger cartilage regeneration in vitro and promoted cartilage repair of TMJOA in vivo. Betaine enhanced the expression of WDR81 in SCAPs during chondrogenesis. WDR81 overexpression promoted chondrogenic differentiation of SCAPs, while WDR81 depletion inhibited chondrogenic differentiation. In addition, both betaine treatment and WDR81 overexpression reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and increased mitochondrial membrane potential in SCAPs. Conclusion: Betaine promotes SCAPs chondrogenic differentiation and provided an effective candidate for TMJOA treatment.

To date, no comprehensive review regarding both the benefits and risks of marathon running on different organ systems has been published. Main Body: The aim of this review was to provide a comprehensive review of the benefits and risks of marathon training and racing on different organ systems. A predefined search strategy including keywords (e.g., marathon, cardiovascular system, etc.) and free text search was used. Articles covering running regardless of sex, age, performance level, and event type (e.g., road races, mountain marathons) were considered, whereas articles examining only cycling, triathlon, stress-tests or other sports were excluded. In total, we found 1021 articles in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, of which 329 studies were included in this review. Overall, marathon training offers several benefits for different organ systems and reduces all-cause mortality. As such, it improves cardiovascular risk factors, leads to favorable cardiac adaptations, enhances lung function, and improves quality of life in chronic kidney disease patients. It also enhances gastrointestinal mobility and reduces the risk of specific tumors such as colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Marathon training enhances bone health and skeletal muscle metabolism. It further positively affects hematopoiesis and cytotoxic abilities of natural killer cells, and may act neuroprotective on a long-term basis. After a marathon, changes in biomarkers suggesting pathological events in certain organ systems such as cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, liver, hematological, immune, musculoskeletal, central nervous, and endocrine systems can often be observed. Mostly, these changes are limited to 1–3 days post-race and usually normalize within a week. Moreover, marathon running poses the risk of serious adverse events such as sudden cardiac death or acute liver failure. Concerning lung function, a decrease after a marathon race was observed. Acute kidney injury, as well as electrolyte imbalances, are relatively common amongst marathon finishers. Many runners complain of gastrointestinal symptoms during or after long-distance running. Many runners suffer from running-related musculoskeletal injuries often impairing performance. A marathon is often accompanied by an acute inflammatory response with transient immunosuppression, making runners susceptible to infections. Also, hormonal alterations such as increased cortisol levels or decreased testosterone levels immediately after a race are observed. Disturbances in sleep patterns are commonly found in marathon runners leading up to or directly after the race. Conclusion: All in all, marathon training is generally safe for human health and individual organ systems.

Methods: TCGA public database and a tissue microarray were used to investigate the molecular characteristics of CLIP4 and its association with disease. TCGA-LIHC dataset was used for single-gene differential expression analysis, single-gene correlation analysis, functional enrichment analysis, immune infiltration analysis, and DNA methylation analysis. RNA-seq, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and RT-qPCR were used to verify the effect of ERS on CLIP4 expression. Public databases and miRNA-seq data were used to explore the TF-miRNA-CLIP4 regulatory network. CCK-8, colony formation, EdU staining, wound-healing, Transwell, western blotting and RT-qPCR were used to detect the effects of CLIP4 on the proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells. Results: Analysis of TCGA datasets and tissue microarrays demonstrated that elevated CLIP4 expression was associated with poor prognosis in HCC. Enrichment analysis revealed that CLIP4 is involved in the immune response, cell adhesion, and EMT. There was a positive correlation between CLIP4 expression and the infiltration of the majority of immune cells, immunomodulators, and chemokines. Furthermore, the DNA methylation pattern of CLIP4 was found to have significant prognostic value. ERS was found to significantly upregulate CLIP4 expression. In addition, the ERS-RELA-miR-222-5p-CLIP4 transcriptional network was constructed to clarify the role of CLIP4. Cell function experiments confirmed that it promotes the proliferation, migration, and EMT of HCC cells. Conclusions: CLIP4 is a potential immune-related oncogenic molecule in HCC. ERS regulates the expression of CLIP4, and CLIP4 promotes the proliferation, migration, and EMT of HCC cells. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218203147

While meniscal repair is the preferred method for preserving knee function, it often has a high failure rate in avascular zones. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of silk-elastin (SE), an artificial protein with wound-healing properties, for enhancing meniscal repair. Eight patients with meniscal tears in avascular areas underwent arthroscopic repair followed by SE application, including cases of lateral and medial tears, discoid lateral meniscus, and bucket-handle tears. No adverse events or reactions were attributed to SE. At 3 months post-surgery, clinical outcomes and repair sites were evaluated using MRI and arthroscopy. Significant improvements were observed in Lysholm and visual analog scale scores (P < 0.05), with the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome scores showing significant improvement in the symptom subscale. MRI findings indicated one patient with grade 1 healing, three with grade 2, and four with grade 3 (unhealed). Arthroscopically, six patients demonstrated completely healed menisci, while two showed incomplete healing; none were classified as “unhealed.” These findings suggest that SE is safe and may support meniscal healing in avascular zones, indicating its potential to improve repair outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218202083

Hyperthermia triggers inflammation, coagulation, and progressive multiorgan dysfunction, and, at levels above 40 °C, can even lead to cell death. Blood cells, particularly granulocytes and platelets, are highly sensitive to heat, which promotes proinflammatory and procoagulant changes. Key factors in heatstroke pathophysiology involve mitochondrial thermal damage and excessive oxidative stress, which drive apoptosis and necrosis. While the kinetics of cellular damage from heat have been extensively studied, the mechanisms driving heat-induced organ damage and death are not yet fully understood. Converse to hyperthermia, hypothermia is generally protective, as seen in therapeutic hypothermia. However, accidental hypothermia presents another environmental threat due to arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and coagulopathy. From a cellular physiology perspective, hypothermia generally supports mitochondrial homeostasis and enhances cell preservation, aiding whole-body recovery following resuscitation.

Emergence of fibroblastic cells in disc degeneration has been reported, yet their nature and origin remain elusive. In this study, we performed an integrative analysis of multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets to interrogate the cellular heterogeneity and fibroblast-like entities in degenerative human NP specimens. We found that disc degeneration severity is associated with an enrichment of fibrocyte phenotype, characterized by CD45 and collagen I dual positivity, and expression of myofibroblast marker α-smooth muscle actin. Refined clustering and classification distinguished the fibrocyte-like populations as subtypes in the NP cells - and immunocytes-clusters, expressing disc degeneration markers HTRA1 and ANGPTL4 and genes related to response to TGF-β. In injury-induced mouse disc degeneration model, fibrocytes were found recruited into the NP undergoing fibrosis and adopted a myofibroblast phenotype. Depleting the fibrocytes in CD11b-DTR mice in which myeloid-derived lineages were ablated by diphtheria toxin could markedly attenuate fibrous modeling and myofibroblast formation in the NP of the degenerative discs, and prevent disc height loss and histomorphological abnormalities. Marker analysis supports that disc degeneration progression is dependent on a function of CD45+COL1A1+ and αSMA+ cells. Our findings reveal that myeloid-derived fibrocytes play a pivotal role in NP fibrosis and may therefore be a target for modifying disc degeneration and promoting its repair. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218198321

The study aimed to evaluate the impact of the intra-socket application of 0.8% Hyaluronic Acid (HA) gel on hard & soft tissue healing after surgical removal of the impacted 3rd molar. Materials and methods: Objective: This randomized controlled clinical study included thirty patients aged from 21–36 years who were scheduled for surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molar. 0.8% hyaluronic acid gel (HA group) was applied immediately after surgery in the intra-socket of 15 patients, and nothing (No HA group) was applied to the socket of the other 15 patients. Soft tissue healing was assessed after extraction on the third, seventh, and fourteenth day. Bone healing was assessed 2 months post-extraction by measuring bone density and socket length from cone beam computerized tomography. Results: The soft tissue healing index was significantly better (very good or excellent) in the HA group compared with no HA group after fourteen days postoperative (p <.001). Also, the percentage increase of bone density in the HA group was statistically significantly higher after two months than in the no HA group ((p <.001). Conclusion: Hyaluronic acid 0.8% gel application improves soft tissue healing and bone density healing following surgical extraction of the mandibular third molar. It could be considered a valuable material for improving bone healing and soft tissue.

The efficacy and compatibility mechanisms of action of BBP in STDP against cardiovascular diseases remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the compatibility effects of BBP in STDP in rats with AMI. Methods: We investigated the compatibility effects of BBP in STDP in rats with AMI. Non-targeted metabonomics, 16S rRNA analysis, RNA sequencing, and network pharmacology were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms. Results: The combination of BBP and CF (STDP without BBP) significantly reduced AMI-induced infarction size, pathological alterations of cardiac tissues, and serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels in rats, compared with CF or BBP treatment alone. Gut microbiota and metabonomics results revealed that the combination treatment could upregulate the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and downregulate that of Helicobacter, Bilophila, and Butyricimonas, thereby rebalancing the gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by AMI. Consequently, the intestinal metabolite levels of oleoylcholine, glutamylalanine, isokobusone, and hemorphin-4 were altered. However, treatment with CF or BBP alone has a weaker effect on these bacteria. Additionally, the combination treatment induced a 62.34% gene reversion rate compared with 55.56% for BBP and 30.20% for CF treatment alone. Modulation of endothelin 1 and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 was identified as a key synergistic mechanism underlying the anti-AMI effects of BBP in STDP. Conclusion: This research provides a scientific explanation of the compatibility of BBP in STDP. Our findings suggested that combination treatment with CF and BBP synergistically attenuates AMI by altering gene expression, gut microbiota, and intestinal metabolite profiles. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218193567

Elucidating the mechanism underlying the dysfunction of MDS-HSCs is crucial for exploring the pathogenesis of the syndrome. While previous studies have implicated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a principal component of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, in the inhibition of normal hematopoiesis, the precise molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of MSCs from MDS patients on hematopoietic functions of HSCs from a metabolic perspective. Methods: MSCs were isolated from BM of MDS patients. The proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and support for hematopoiesis of these cells were analyzed using CCK-8 assay, FC and induction medium and CFU (colony forming units) assay, respectively. Expression levels of metabolic molecules were used as indicators to screen MSCs with different metabolic pathways and were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Exosome derived from MSCs were isolated from the culture supernatant and confirmed by Transmission Electron Microscope, Dynamic Light Scattering and Western blotting. The effects of these exosomes on HSCs were analyzed using the same methods as those used to assess MSCs function. Results: Our findings demonstrated that MDS-MSCs exhibited significant functional impairments, including reduced proliferation, impaired differentiation, diminished support for hematopoiesis, and increased apoptosis. Notably, we observed an upregulation of lipid metabolism in these MSCs, which appears to contribute to their dysfunction. Intriguingly, the aberrant lipid metabolic profile can be effectively reversed by the administration of etomoxir (ETO), an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT-1A). Furthermore, MSCs with enhanced lipid metabolism could transmit this dysfunction to HSCs through the secretion of exosomes that are enriched in CPT-1A. Conclusions: We suggest that the MDS BM microenvironment disrupts MSCs metabolism by increasing the expression of CPT-1A, which impairs the ability to support normal HSCs. Interestingly, the suppressive effect is mediated by exosomes rich in CPT-1A, which derived from MSCs. These findings provide novel insights into MDS MSCs-metabolism-Exosome axis in ineffective hematopoiesis and offer new strategies for the treatment of MDS. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218192960

While unraveling the intricate interplay between the tumor microenvironment and tumor behaviors represents a tremendous challenge, recent research illuminates a crucial biological phenomenon known as cellular mechanotransduction. Within the microenvironment, mechanical cues like tensile stress, shear stress, and stiffness play a pivotal role by activating mechanosensitive effectors such as PIEZO proteins, integrins, and Yes-associated protein. This activation initiates cascades of intrinsic signaling pathways, effectively linking the physical properties of tissues to their physiological and pathophysiological processes like morphogenesis, regeneration, and immunity. This mechanistic insight offers a novel perspective on how the mechanical cues within the tumor microenvironment impact tumor behaviors. While the intricacies of the mechanical tumor microenvironment are yet to be fully elucidated, it exhibits distinct physical attributes from non-malignant tissues, including elevated solid stresses, interstitial hypertension, augmented matrix stiffness, and enhanced viscoelasticity. These traits exert notable influences on tumor progression and treatment responses, enriching our comprehension of the multifaceted nature of the microenvironment. Through this innovative review, we aim to provide a new lens to decipher the mechanical attributes within the tumor microenvironment from non-malignant contexts, broadening our knowledge on how these factors promote or inhibit tumor behaviors, and thus offering valuable insights to identify potential targets for anti-tumor strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218189410

Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is widely used to treat TD, but this regimen can lead to a series of side effects. Stem cell therapy has been wildly studied in vitro. However, due to the multidirectional differentiation potential and heterogeneity of stem cells, it is difficult to achieve the good efficiency and reproducibility in basic research and clinical applications. This study aims to identify a new strategy for the treatment of TD. Methods: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) were enucleated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. The organelles and cellular functions of enucleated BMSCs were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized. For the animal studies, enucleated BMSCs were labelled with Mitotracker and injected into ethane dimethanesulfone (EDS)-treated rats. Testosterone production and spermatogenesis were detected at different time points through various tests. To determine the mechanism of efferocytosis, we analysed the number of macrophages by immunofluorescence staining and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: The injection of enucleated BMSCs (Cargocytes) into the testes of EDS-treated rats restored the levels of serum testosterone, increased the number of Leydig cells (LCs), and improved spermatogenesis. We found that enucleated BMSCs underwent apoptosis earlier than BMSCs did. Subsequently, testicular interstitial macrophages phagocytosed apoptotic enucleated BMSCs through efferocytosis. Efferocytosis promoted macrophage polarization from the M1 to the M2 phenotype, reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and decreased the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress. Conclusions: In summary, this study pioneered the application of stromal cell enucleation technology to repair tissue damage in the reproductive system, explored the potential of cell burial in the treatment of reproductive system diseases and provided a new approach for the clinical treatment of male infertility. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218189346

However, the similarities and differences in gene expression patterns and immune responses between these two sites have not been extensively studied. Results: Four lines of matched nasal and bronchial airway epithelial cells obtained from the four patients were embedded in Matrigel and cultured in thechemically defined medium to generate patient-derived nasal organoids (NO) and bronchial organoids (BO). Histologic examination of nasal organoid tissue revealed high similarity and a reduced ciliary beat frequency compared to bronchial organoid tissue. Whole exome sequencing revealed that over 99% of single nucleotides were shared between the NO and matched BO and there was a 95% overlap in their RNA transcriptomes. RNA sequencing analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated a significant reduction in the immune response in NO. RSV infection revealed more productive replication in NO, with a downregulated immune pathway identified by RNA sequencing analysis and upregulated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in culture supernatants in NO compared to BO. Conclusions: NO and BO serve as robust in vitro models, faithfully recapitulating the biological characteristics of upper respiratory epithelial cells. The different regions of respiratory epithelial cells exhibit distinct immune responses, underscoring their complementary roles in exploring airway immune mechanisms and disease pathophysiology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218184790

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a widely used biochemical stimulus for promoting neuronal maturation. However, the broad effects of biochemical stimuli on multiple cellular functions limit their applicability in both in vitro models and clinical settings. Electrical stimulation (ES) offers a promising physical method to control cell fate and function, but it is hampered by lack of standard and optimised protocols. In this study, we demonstrate that ES outperforms BDNF in promoting neuronal maturation in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y. Additionally, we address the question regarding which ES parameters regulate biological responses. The neuronal differentiation and maturation of SH-SY5Y cells were tested under several pulsed ES regimes. We identified accumulated charge and effective electric field time as novel criteria for determining optimal ES regimes. ES parameters were obtained using electrochemical characterisation and equivalent circuit modelling. Our findings show that neuronal maturation in SH-SY5Y cells correlates with the amount of accumulated charge during ES. Higher charge accumulation (~ 50 mC/h) significantly promotes extensive neurite outgrowth and ramification, and enhances the expression of synaptophysin, yielding effects exceeding those of BDNF. In contrast, fewer charge injection to the culture (~ 0.1 mC/h) minimally induces maturation but significantly increases cell proliferation. Moreover, ES altered the concentration and protein cargo of secreted extracellular vesicles (EV). ES with large enough accumulated charge significantly enriched EV proteome associated with neural development and function. These results demonstrate that each ES regime induces distinct cellular responses. Increased accumulated charge facilitates the development of complex neuronal morphologies and axonal ramification, outperforming exogenous neurotrophic factors. Controlled ES methods are immediately applicable in creating mature neuronal cultures in vitro with minimal chemical intervention. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218184669

One of the main causes of CKD is diabetes mellitus (DM), and oxidative stress is essential to the disease's development. It has been demonstrated that the natural antioxidant melatonin reduces inflammation and oxidative damage in renal tissues. Given the lack of robust evidence, this double-blind clinical trial sought to investigate the effects of melatonin supplementation on oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in diabetic CKD patients. Materials and methods: This trial included 41 diabetic patients with CKD (stages 3–4) from Shariati Hospital, Tehran, Iran. For ten weeks, participants were randomized to receive either a placebo or 5 mg of melatonin twice a day. Baseline characteristics, dietary intake, physical activity, and anthropometric measurements were recorded. Oxidative stress (TAC, TOS, MDA) and inflammatory markers (IL-6, hs-CRP) were measured before and after the intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, with significance set at p < 0.05. Results: The 10-week trial was completed by 41 participants in total, and no adverse effects were noted. Dietary intake, physical activity, and anthropometric parameters did not significantly differ between the melatonin and control groups in baseline characteristics. Melatonin supplementation decreased oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers, including hs-CRP, MDA, TOS, and IL-6. However, these changes were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Our study showed that melatonin supplementation did not significantly affect oxidative stress or inflammatory markers, including TAC, TOS, MDA, IL-6, and hs-CRP, in diabetic patients with CKD. Despite a decrement in TOS, MDA, IL-6, and hs-CRP levels after 10 weeks, this was not statistically significant.

EVs transport transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which is commonly activated under late stages of cancer progression. Nevertheless, whether TGF-β signaling coordinates EV biogenesis is a relevant topic that remains minimally explored. Method: We sought after specific TGF-β pathway mediators that could regulate EV release. To this end, we used a large number of cancer cell models, coupled to EV cell biological assays, unbiased proteomic and transcriptomic screens, followed by signaling and cancer biology analyses, including drug resistance assays. Results: We report that TGF-β, by activating its type I receptor and MEK-ERK1/2 signaling, increased the numbers of EVs released by human cancer cells. Upon examining cholesterol as a mediator of EV biogenesis, we delineated a pathway whereby ERK1/2 acted by phosphorylating sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 that transcriptionally induced 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase expression, thus raising cholesterol abundance at both cellular and EV levels. Notably, inhibition of MEK or cholesterol synthesis, which impaired TGF-β-induced EV secretion, sensitized cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, proteomic profiling of two distinct EV populations revealed that EVs secreted by TGF-β-stimulated cells were either depleted or enriched for different sets of cargo proteins. Among these, latent-TGF-β1 present in the EVs was not affected by TGF-β signaling, while TGF-β pathway-related molecules (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases, including MMP9) were either uniquely enriched on EVs or strongly enhanced after TGF-β stimulation. EV-associated latent-TGF-β1 activated SMAD signaling, even when EV uptake was blocked by heparin, indicating competent signaling capacity from target cell surface receptors. MMP inhibitor or proteinase treatment blocked EV-mediated SMAD signaling, suggesting that EVs require MMP activity to release the active TGF-β from its latent complex, a function also linked to the EV-mediated transfer of pro-migratory potential and ability of cancer cells to survive in the presence of cytotoxic drugs. Conclusion: Hence, we delineated a novel signaling cascade that leads to high rates of EV generation by cancer cells in response to TGF-β, with cholesterol being a key intermediate step in this mechanism. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218180431

Deletion of the core clock gene Bmal1 leads to pathological bone alterations, while the phenotypes are not consistent. Studies have shown that multiple signaling pathways are involved in the process of Bmal1 regulating bone and cartilage metabolism, but the exact regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. This paper reviews the signaling pathways by which Bmal1 regulates bone/cartilage metabolism, the upstream regulatory factors that control Bmal1, and the current Bmal1 knockout mouse models for research.

This study aims to investigate the role of thermo-sensitive chitosan/hydroxyethyl cellulose/glycerophosphate (CS/HEC/GP) hydrogel encapsulated CB-MNCs in pressure ulcer wound healing. Methods: Pressure ulcers were induced on the backs of aged mice. After construction and validation of the characterization of thermo-sensitive CS/HEC/GP hydrogel, CB-MNCs are encapsulated in the hydrogel, called CB-MNCs@CS/HEC/GP which was locally applied to the mouse wounds. Mouse skin tissues were harvested for histological and molecular biology analyses. Results: CB-MNCs@CS/HEC/GP therapy accelerated pressure ulcer wound healing, attenuated inflammatory responses, promoted cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and collagen synthesis. Further investigation revealed that CB-MNCs@CS/HEC/GP exerted therapeutic effects by promoting changes in cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, and smooth muscle cells. Conclusion: CB-MNCs@CS/HEC/GP enhanced the delivery efficiency of CB-MNCs, preserved the cell viability, and contributed to pressure ulcer wound healing. Thus, CB-MNCs@CS/HEC/GP represents a novel therapeutic approach for skin regeneration of chronic wounds. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218180016

However, it is still unclear whether myonuclear accretion is driven by increased mechanical loading per se, or occurs, at least in part, in response to muscle injury/regeneration. Here, we developed a non-damaging protocol to evaluate contractile activity-induced myonuclear accretion/hypertrophy in physiological conditions. Methods: Contractile activity was generated by applying repeated electrical stimuli over the mouse plantar flexor muscles. This method is commonly referred to as NeuroMuscular Electrical Simulation (NMES) in Human. Each NMES training session consisted of 80 isometric contractions delivered at ∼15% of maximal tetanic force to avoid muscle damage. C57BL/6J male mice were submitted to either a short (i.e., 6 sessions) or long (i.e., 12 sessions) individualized NMES training program while unstimulated mice were used as controls. Histological investigations were performed to assess the impact of NMES on MuSC number and status, myonuclei content and muscle tissue integrity, typology and size. Results: NMES led to a robust proliferation of MuSCs and myonuclear accretion in the absence of overt signs of muscle damage/regeneration. NMES-induced myonuclear accretion was specific to type IIB myofibers and was an early event preceding muscle hypertrophy inasmuch as a mild increase in myofiber cross-sectional area was only observed in response to the long-term NMES training protocol. Conclusion: We conclude that NMES-induced myonuclear accretion and muscle hypertrophy are driven by a mild increase in mechanical loading in the absence of overt signs of muscle injury. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218171792

This study compares the anti-obesity effects of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to orlistat in an experimental model of induced obesity in Wistar Albino rats. In addition to negative and positive control rats, obese rats were treated with variable daily and weekly doses of AuNPs and daily orlistat for nine weeks. Bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) and dissection techniques were used to indirectly and directly measure body-composition in all rat groups. Hepatic and renal function and ultrastructure were assessed by blood biochemical and histological examinations to detect treatment-related alterations. High doses of AuNPs reduced body fat, increased muscle mass, improved dyslipidemia, glycemia, and antioxidant effects in obese rats, and restored normal TG, FBG, and MDA levels by reducing obesity-related oxidative damage. Histological and ultrastructural examinations showed that these high doses repaired liver and kidney cells, and reduced fat accumulation and body weight compared to the standard treatment for obesity by orlistat. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218155930

Previous studies primarily focused on the effect of fluoride content on enamel remineralization, neglecting the role of FHA particle size. This study aimed to synthesize uniform FHA nanorods of varying sizes by adjusting the fluorine doping levels, and to investigate the synergistic effects of the fluorine content and nanorod size on enamel remineralization by incorporating the FHA nanorods into adhesives. Methods: FHA nanorods with varying fluorine doping levels and sizes were synthesized based on a hydrothermal method. The characterization analyses of FHA nanorods were demonstrated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The composite adhesives containing 10 wt% different FHA nanorods were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The colloidal stability, light-curing poperties, and degree of conversion (DC %) were assessed. The shear bond strength (SBS) was determined and the failure mode analysis was reported. The release of Ca2+ and F− within 30 days was detected. The remineralization was evaluated via SEM, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), XRD, and micro-hardness through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, Levene test, one-way ANOVA, Tukey HSD method, Welch test, Tamhane test, Fisher’s exact test and Kruskal-Wallis test (α = 0.05). Results: Uniform FHA nanorods of varying sizes were synthesized by adjusting the fluorine doping level (2 wt%, 6 wt%, and 10 wt%). The lengths of these FHA nanorods were 505.31 ± 104.43 nm, 111.27 ± 22.89 nm, and 66.21 ± 12.68 nm, respectively. The composite adhesives containing FHA nanorods showed good colloidal stability and appropriate light-curing properties. The SBS of composite adhesives decreased due to the incorporation of FHA nanorods, but the values still remained within the clinically required range. Three groups of the composite adhesives could release Ca2+ and F− continuously. The group of 10 wt% F-doped HA nanorods with shorter lengths exhibited more mineral deposition and absorption of Ca²⁺ onto the adhesive and enamel surfaces. Conclusions: The strategy of adding the synthesized FHA nanorods into dental adhesives can be an effective approach to promote enamel remineralization, while maintaining adequate bond strength. The 10 wt% F-doped HA nanorods with shorter lengths exhibited superior remineralization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218139711

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies have emerged as a promising alternative, given their potential to modulate various pathways involved in wound healing. This study evaluates and compares the therapeutic potential of MSCs derived from perinatal tissues—human umbilical cord MSCs (hUCMSCs), human chorionic villi MSCs (hCVMSCs), and human decidua basalis MSCs (hDCMSCs)—in a diabetic wound healing model. Methods: We performed in vitro and in vivo studies to compare the efficacy of hUCMSCs, hCVMSCs, and hDCMSCs. Mass spectrometry was used to analyze the secreted proteins of the MSCs. We incorporated the MSCs into a polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) and sodium alginate (SA) hydrogel matrix with collagen I (Col-I) to evaluate their effects on wound healing. Results: All three types of MSCs promoted wound healing, with hUCMSCs and hCVMSCs showing stronger effects compared to hDCMSCs. Both hUCMSCs and hCVMSCs demonstrated robust wound healing kinetics, with enhanced keratinocyte proliferation (KRT14+/Ki67+ cells), maturation (KRT10/KRT14 ratio), and angiogenesis. In vitro studies demonstrated that the MSC-derived secretome enhanced keratinocyte proliferation and migration, endothelial cell function and stem cell recruitment, indicating robust paracrine effects. Mass spectrometry revealed a conserved set of proteins including THBS1 (thrombospondin 1), SERPINE1 (serpin family E member 1), ANXA1 (annexin A1), LOX (lysyl oxidase), and ITGB1 (integrin beta-1) which are involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and wound healing, with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway playing a central role. The PEGDA/SA/Col-I hydrogel demonstrated a unique balance of mechanical and biological properties and an optimal environment for MSC viability and function. Application of either hUCMSC- or hCVMSC-laden hydrogels resulted in accelerated wound closure, improved re-epithelialization, increased collagen deposition, and enhanced vascularization in vivo. Conclusions: MSCs From perinatal tissues particularly hUCMSCs and hCVMSCs significantly enhance diabetic wound healing through PI3K/AKT pathway activation while hDCMSCs exhibited weaker efficacy. The PEGDA/SA/Col-I hydrogel supports MSC viability and function offering a promising scaffold for DFU treatment.

HOXA overexpression caused by genetic alterations, such as KMT2A rearrangements, NUP98- fusions and FLT3-ITD mutations, is frequently identified in AML. However, very few studies determined the DNA methylation-mediated epigenetic regulation of the HOXA cluster genes in AML. Methods: We systematically first screened the prognostic value of HOXA cluster genes methylation in AML from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. Afterwards, the candidate prognosis-related gene HOXA9 were selected for clinical relevance analysis and were further validated in another independent cohort from our research center. Results: The methylation of HOXA9, among HOXA cluster genes, negatively correlated with adverse prognosis and expression were screened and identified in AML among TCGA datasets. Clinically, HOXA9 hypomethylation was positively correlated with specific subtypes of AML, such as French-American-British (FAB)-M5/M7, normal karyotype and FLT3, NPM1 and DNMT3A mutation, whereas negatively associated with FAB-M3, t(15;17), t(8;21) and t(16;16). Importantly, AML patients with HOXA9 hypomethylation may profit from transplantation, whereas AML patients with HOXA9 hypermethylation could not, suggesting that HOXA9 methylation may be used to guide therapeutic selection between transplantation and chemotherapy. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated the association of HOXA9 expression with diverse leukemia-related genes (HOXAs, SOSTDC1, MEG3, miR-10a, miR-381 and miR-193b) and signaling pathways (PI3K-Akt signaling) in AML. Subsequently, we further validate the hypomethylation pattern of HOXA9 in AML patients and the epigenetic regulation of HOXA9 methylation in AML cell-lines. Conclusions: HOXA9 methylation linked to HOXA9 expression correlates with diverse genetic abnormalities of AML, such as normal karyotype, t(15;17), t(8;21), t(16;16) and FLT3, NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations. Moreover, HOXA9 hypomethylation may be associated with adverse prognosis, and may guide treatment choice in AML. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218089613

We focus on microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and exogenous ncRNAs and their roles in regulating key signaling pathways such as the Wnt/β signaling pathway. β-catenin, PI3K/Akt, and TGF-β. We also discuss the potential of ncRNAs and exogenous ncRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for CRC, as well as their potential as therapeutic targets for CRC. Advances in ncRNA-based therapies present promising opportunities for the development of new therapies for CRC.

Improving bone formation driven by osteoblasts has shown promising outcomes in the prognosis of SIONFH. Isovitexin has demonstrated antioxidant properties, but its therapeutic effects on GC-induced oxidative stress and SIONFH remain unexplored. In this study, we analyzed clinical samples obtained from SIONFH patients using proteomic and bioinformatic approaches. We found an imbalance in mitochondrial homeostasis and ferroptosis-induced impairment of osteogenic capacity in SIONFH. Subsequently, we investigated the cause-and-effect relationship between mitochondria and ferroptosis, as well as the regulatory role of mitophagy in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and controlling ferroptosis. We then identified the critical involvement of SIRT3 in modulating mitochondrial homeostasis and ferroptosis. Furthermore, molecular docking and co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the strong interaction between SIRT3 and BNIP3. Strikingly, restoring SIRT3 expression significantly inhibited pathological mitophagy mediated by the BNIP3/NIX pathway. Additionally, we discovered that Isovitexin, by promoting SIRT3 expression, effectively regulated mitophagy, preserved mitochondrial homeostasis in osteoblasts, suppressed ferroptosis, and restored osteogenic capacity, leading to remarkable improvements in SIONFH. These findings reveal the effects and molecular mechanisms of Isovitexin on SIONFH and highlight the potential of targeting SIRT3 as a promising strategy to suppress mitophagy-mediated ferroptosis in osteoblasts and against SIONFH. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218080744

In the present study, we aimed to investigate critical circRNA biomarkers associated with male osteoporosis. Methods: RNA-sequencing was performed to investigate the circRNA expression profiles between 3 men with osteoporosis and 3 with normal mass density. Then, shared mRNAs between host genes acquired in this present study and mRNAs acquired in previous study were identified to screen vital circRNAs associated with male osteoporosis. PPI networks of shared mRNAs were constructed and the hub genes in the PPI networks were identified with CytoHubba, a plugin in Cytoscape software (3.10.1). Finally, a ceRNA network of four circRNAs derived from three hub genes was constructed. Validation experiments were performed on selected circRNAs and related miRNAs in this ceRNA network using peripheral blood clinical samples. Results: In total, 657 circRNAs were detected in male osteoporosis. The shared mRNAs were significantly enriched in the metabolic pathways, RNA transport, Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Then, three genes, including SETD2, ATM and XPO1, were identified as hub genes with four algorithms. Ultimately, the ceRNA network, involving 4 circRNAs, 40 miRNAs, and 592 mRNAs, was obtained. Using 35 clinical samples, three potential circRNAs and three miRNAs associated with male osteoporosis were selected for validation. It was ultimately found that three miRNAs were upregulated in MOP, while hsa-circ-9130, novel_circ_0014940 and hsa-circ-0054894 were upregulated, hsa-circ-2484 and novel_circ_0033084 were downregulated in patients with MOP. Conclusion: We emphasized the roles of several significantly up- and down-regulated circRNAs and four circRNAs derived from three hub genes in male osteoporosis. Differences in expression were confirmed for three miRNAs and five circRNAs in the ceRNA network among patients with male osteoporosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218070695

Fibroblasts are the most important effector cells involved in HS formation. Currently no satisfactory treatment has been developed. Methods: The impact of fraxinellone (FRA) on the proliferation and migration capacity of human hypertrophic scar-derived fibroblasts (HSFs) was assessed by EdU proliferation, wound healing and transwell assays. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT‒PCR), Western blot (WB), immunofluorescence staining and collagen gel contraction assays were performed to evaluate the collagen production and activation capacity of HSFs. Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read RNA sequencing (ONT long-read RNA-seq) revealed the occurrence of ferroptosis in HSF and ferroptosis executioner-cathepsin B (CTSB). The mechanisms underlying FRA-induced HSF ferroptosis were examined through fluorescence staining, qRT‒PCR, WB and molecular docking study. The therapeutic efficacy of FRA was further validated in vivo using a rabbit ear scar model. Results: FRA treatment significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration, collagen production and activation capacity of HSFs. ONT long-read RNA-seq discovered that FRA modulated the expression of transcripts related to ferroptosis and lysosomes. Mechanistically, FRA treatment reduced the protein expression level of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and induced the release of CTSB from lysosomes into the cytoplasm. CTSB further induced ferroptosis via spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase (SAT1)-mediated lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway activation, eventually affecting the function of HSFs. Moreover, FRA treatment attenuated the formation of HS in rabbit ears via CTSB-mediated ferroptosis. The antifibrotic effects of FRA were abrogated by pretreatment with a CTSB inhibitor (CA-074-me). Conclusions: This study reveals that FRA ameliorates HS by inducing CTSB leakage from lysosomes, causing SAT1-mediated lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage and MAPK signalling pathway activation, thus mediating HSF ferroptosis. Therefore, FRA could be a promising therapeutic agent for treating HS. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218045351

While the quality and length of life of MM patients have significantly increased, MM remains a hard-to-treat disease; almost all patients relapse. As MM is highly heterogenous, patients relapse at different times. It is currently not possible to predict when relapse will occur; numerous studies investigating the dysregulation of non-coding RNA molecules in cancer suggest that microRNAs could be good markers of relapse. Results: Using small RNA sequencing, we profiled microRNA expression in peripheral blood in three groups of MM patients who relapsed at different intervals. In total, 24 microRNAs were significantly dysregulated among analyzed subgroups. Independent validation by RT-qPCR confirmed changed levels of miR-598-3p in MM patients with different times to relapse. At the same time, differences in the mass spectra between groups were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. All results were analyzed by machine learning. Conclusion: Mass spectrometry coupled with machine learning shows potential as a reliable, rapid, and cost-effective preliminary screening technique to supplement current diagnostics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218041604

This intricate process consists of four sequential and overlapping phases: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Hemostasis immediately begins to function in response to vascular injury, forming a clot that stops the bleeding. To fight infection and remove debris, immune cells are enlisted during the inflammatory phase. Angiogenesis, re-epithelialization, and the creation of new tissue are all components of proliferation, whereas tissue maturation and scarring are the outcomes of remodeling. Chronic wounds, like those found in diabetic ulcers, frequently stay in a state of chronic inflammation because they are unable to go through these stages in a coordinated manner. The important regulatory roles that microRNAs (miRNAs) play in both normal and pathological wound healing have been highlighted by recent investigations. The miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs, modulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, profoundly impacting cellular functions. During the inflammatory phase, miRNAs control pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the activity of immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. Additionally, miRNAs are essential components of signaling networks related to inflammation, such as the toll-like receptor (TLR), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), and Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways. Some miRNAs have been discovered to either increase or alleviate inflammatory reactions, indicating their potential as therapeutic targets. Other miRNAs aid in angiogenesis by promoting the development of new blood vessels, which are essential for providing oxygen and nutrients to the healing tissue. They also affect keratinocyte migration and proliferation during the re-epithelialization phase, which involves growing new epithelial cells over the lesion. Another function of miRNAs is that they control the deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and the creation of scars during the remodeling phase. The abnormal expression of miRNAs in chronic wounds has led to the exploration of miRNA-based treatments. With a focus on resistant instances such as diabetic wounds, these therapeutic techniques seek to improve wound healing results by correcting the dysregulated miRNA expression. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218018174

This state of health is increasingly prevalent and poses public health challenges. Adapting approaches to effectively analyse electronic health records is needed to better understand multimorbidity. We propose a novel unsupervised clustering approach to multiple time-to-event health records denoted as multiple state clustering analysis (MSCA). In MSCA, patients’ pairwise dissimilarities are computed using patients’ state matrices which are composed of multiple censored time-to-event indicators reflecting patients’ health history. The use of state matrices enables the analysis of an arbitrary number of LTCs without reducing patients’ health trajectories to a particular sequence of events. MSCA was applied to analyse multimorbidity associated with myocardial infarction using electronic health records of 26 LTCs, including conventional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) such as diabetes and hypertension, collected from south London general practices between 2005 and 2021 in 5087 patients using the MSCA R library. We identified a typology of 11 clusters, characterised by age at onset of myocardial infarction, sequences of conventional CVRFs and non-conventional risk factors including physical and mental health conditions. Interestingly, multivariate analysis revealed that clusters were also associated with various combinations of socio-demographic characteristics including gender and ethnicity. By identifying meaningful sequences of LTCs associated with myocardial infarction and distinct socio-demographic characteristics, MSCA proves to be an effective approach to the analysis of electronic health records, with the potential to enhance our understanding of multimorbidity for improved prevention and management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217994966

The pathophysiology of lung I/R injury involves ferroptosis and elevated protein O-GlcNAcylation levels, while the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on lung I/R injury remains unclear. This research aimed to explore the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on reducing ferroptosis in pulmonary epithelial cells caused by I/R. Results: First, we identified O-GlcNAc transferase 1 (Ogt1) as a differentially expressed gene in lung epithelial cells of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) patients, using single-cell sequencing, and Gene Ontology analysis (GO analysis) revealed the enrichment of the ferroptosis process. We found a time-dependent dynamic alteration in lung O-GlcNAcylation during I/R injury. Proteomics analysis identified the differentially expressed proteins enriched in ferroptosis and multiple redox-related pathways based on KEGG annotation. Thus, we generated Ogt1-conditional knockout mice and found that Ogt1 deficiency aggravated ferroptosis, as evidenced by lipid reactive oxygen species (lipid ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), Fe2+, as well as alterations in critical protein expression glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). Consistently, we found that elevated O-GlcNAcylation inhibited ferroptosis sensitivity in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury-induced TC-1 cells via O-GlcNAcylated NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Furthermore, both the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and the dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that Nrf2 could bind with translation start site (TSS) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and promote its transcriptional activity. As an important rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), elevated G6PDH provided a mass of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to improve the redox state of glutathione (GSH) and eventually led to ferroptosis resistance. Rescue experiments proved that Nrf2 knockdown or Nrf2-T334A (O-GlcNAcylation site) mutation abolished the protective effect of ferroptosis resistance. Conclusions: In summary, we revealed that O-GlcNAcylation could protect against I/R lung injury by reducing ferroptosis sensitivity via the Nrf2/G6PDH pathway.

Furthermore, the optimal delivery route for stem cells remains undetermined. While the cytokines secreted by stem cells show promise in modulating post-stroke inflammation, the direct application of these supernatants in ischemic stroke treatment and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Methods: Secretory supernatants (hMSC-L) and cell lysate products (hMSC-M) from primary human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells-cultured medium were administered intranasally to mice with cerebral ischemia. The neuroprotective effects of hMSC-L and hMSC-M were assessed with TTC staining, behavioral tests and pathological staining. Flow cytometry and qPCR evaluated the expression of immune cells and cytokines in the CNS and peripheral immune organs. In vitro, flow cytometry and ELISA measured the effects of hMSC-L and hMSC-M on N2 polarization and inflammatory cytokines expression in primary murine neutrophils. Western blot analysis determined the impact of hMSC-L and hMSC-M on the PPAR-γ/STAT6/SOCS1 pathway, which is crucial for N2 neutrophil polarization. Results: TTC staining, behavioral experiments, and pathological assessments reveal intranasal delivery of hMSC-L and hMSC-M significantly reduces the infarct volume of mice with cerebral ischemia, improves neurological function scores, and promotes motor function recovery. Higher concentrations of hMSC-M contributed a more pronounced effect on neuropathological improvements in ischemic mice. Intranasal delivery of hMSC-L and hMSC-M significantly reduces neutrophil infiltration in the brain post-stroke and increases the proportion of anti-inflammatory N2-subtype neutrophils, boosting the expression levels of IL-10 and TGF-β. In vitro experiments demonstrate that hMSC-L and hMSC-M promote nuclear translocation of PPAR-γ in neutrophils stimulated with PMA, activating the downstream STAT6/SOCS1 signaling pathway to encourage N2-subtype neutrophil polarization. Conclusions: Intranasal delivery of hMSC-L and hMSC-M effectively ameliorates cerebral ischemic injury in mice, comparable to traditional administration routes like intravenous delivery. Treatment with hMSC-L and hMSC-M enhances the PPAR-γ/STAT6/SOCS1 pathway and improves the neuroinflammatory response post-stroke by increasing N2 neutrophil infiltration. These results provide a theoretical basis for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of stem cell therapy and for exploring suitable delivery pathways of stem cell treatment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217875224

This β cell loss occurs primarily through inflammatory pathways culminating in apoptosis. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been heavily studied for therapeutic applications due to their regenerative, anti-apoptotic, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties. The therapeutic effects of MSCs are mediated through cell-to-cell contact, differentiation, and the release of paracrine factors, which include the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Culturing MSCs in hypoxia, a low oxygen tension state more analogous to their physiological environment, seems to increase the therapeutic efficacy of MSC cell therapy, enhancing their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic properties. This is also the case with MSC-derived EVs, which show altered properties based on the parent cell preconditioning. In this review, we examine the evidence supporting the potential application of hypoxic preconditioning in strengthening MSC-EVs for treating the inflammatory and apoptotic causes of β cell loss in T1D. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217874866

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation is currently one of the most promising methods for β-cell replacement therapy. However, recent studies have shown that ferroptosis is not only one of the key mechanisms of β-cell death, but also one of the reasons for extensive cell death within a short period of time after MSCs transplantation. Ferroptosis is a new type of regulated cell death (RCD) characterized by iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides. Due to the weak antioxidant capacity of β-cells, they are susceptible to cytotoxic stimuli such as oxidative stress (OS), and are therefore susceptible to ferroptosis. Transplanted MSCs are also extremely susceptible to perturbations in their microenvironment, especially OS, which can weaken their antioxidant capacity and induce MSCs death through ferroptosis. In the pathophysiological process of T1DM, a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced, causing OS. Therefore, targeting ferroptosis may be a key way to protect β-cells and improve the therapeutic effect of MSCs transplantation. This review reviews the research related to ferroptosis of β-cells and MSCs, and summarizes the currently developed strategies that help inhibit cell ferroptosis. This study aims to help understand the ferroptosis mechanism of β-cell death and MSCs death after transplantation, emphasize the importance of targeting ferroptosis for protecting β-cells and improving the survival and function of transplanted MSCs, and provide a new research direction for stem cells transplantation therapy of T1DM in the future. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217872441

Diseases in this region pose significant diagnostic and management challenges; therefore, exploring new strategies for early diagnosis, targeted treatment, and tissue reconstruction is key to improving patient prognosis and quality of life. Extracellular vesicles are a group of heterogeneous lipid-bilayer membrane structures secreted by most cell types, including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. Present in various body fluids and tissues, they act as messengers via the transfer of nucleic acids, proteins, and metabolites to recipient cells. To date, studies have revealed the different roles of extracellular vesicles in physiological or pathological processes, as well as applications in disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. The importance and tissue specificity of the dental and maxillofacial tissues indicate that extracellular vesicles derived from this region are promising for further research.

Aberrant O-GlcNAcylation has been observed in many cancers including endometrial cancer (EC), a common malignancy in women. However, clinical characterization of dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation homeostasis in EC and interrogating its molecular mechanism remain incomplete. Here we report that O-GlcNAcylation level is positively correlated with EC histologic grade in a Chinese cohort containing 219 tumors, validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. Increasing O-GlcNAcylation in patient-derived endometrial epithelial organoids promotes proliferation and stem-like cell properties, whereas decreasing O-GlcNAcylation limits the growth of endometrial cancer organoids. CRISPR screen and biochemical characterization reveal that tumor suppressor F-box only protein 31 (FBXO31) regulates O-GlcNAcylation homeostasis in EC by ubiquitinating the O-GlcNAc transferase OGT.

This encounter has the potential to dictate their therapeutic efficacy (also referred to as licensing). MSCs are able to rapidly react to cellular damage by migrating to the inflamed tissue and ultimately modifying the inflammatory microenvironment. However, the limited use of MSCs in clinical practice can be attributed to a lack of understanding of the fate of MSCs in patients after administration and long term MSC-derived therapeutic activity. While the known physiological effectors of viable MSCs make a relative contribution, an innate property of MSCs as a therapeutic agent is their caspase-dependent cell death. These mechanisms may be involving the functional reprogramming of myeloid phagocytes via efferocytosis, the process by which apoptotic bodies (ABs) are identified for engulfment by both specialized and non-specialized phagocytic cells. Recent studies have provided evidence that the uptake of ABs with a distinct genetic component can induce changes in gene expression through the process of epigenetic remodeling. This phenomenon, known as ‘trained immunity’, has a significant impact on immunometabolism processes. It is hypothesized that the diversity of recipient cells within the inflammatory stroma adjacent to MSCs may potentially serve as a biomarker for predicting the clinical outcome of MSC treatment, while also contributing to the variable outcomes observed with MSC-based therapies. Therefore, the long-term reconstructive process of MSCs may potentially be mediated by MSC apoptosis and subsequent phagocyte-mediated efferocytosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217851609

Extracellular vesicles derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC-EVs) possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, offering a potential strategy for combating weightless muscular atrophy. Methods: In this study, human BMSCs-EVs (hBMSC-EVs) were isolated using super-centrifugation and characterized. C2C12 myotube nutrition-deprivation and mice tail suspension models were established. Subsequently, the diameter of C2C12 myotubes, Soleus mass, cross-sectional area (CSA) of muscle fibers, and grip strength in mice were assessed to investigate the impact of hBMSC-EVs on muscle atrophy. Immunostaining, transmission electron microscopy observation, and western blot analysis were employed to assess the impact of hBMSC-EVs on muscle fiber types, ROS levels, inflammation, ubiquitin–proteasome system activity, and autophagy lysosome pathway activation in skeletal muscle atrophy. Results: The active hBMSC-EVs can be internalized by C2C12 myotubes and skeletal muscle. hBMSC-EVs can effectively reduce C2C12 myotube atrophy caused by nutritional deprivation, with a concentration of 10 × 108 particles/mL showing the best effect (P < 0.001). Additionally, hBMSC-EVs can down-regulate the protein levels associated with UPS and oxidative stress. Moreover, intravenous administration of hBMSC-EVs at a concentration of 1 × 1010 particles/mL can effectively reverse the reduction in soleus mass (P < 0.001), CSA (P < 0.01), and grip strength (P < 0.001) in mice caused by weightlessness. They demonstrate the ability to inhibit protein degradation mediated by UPS and autophagy lysosome pathway, along with the suppression of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, hBMSC-EVs impede the transition of slow muscle fibers to fast muscle fibers via upregulation of Sirt1 and PGC-1α protein levels. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that hBMSC-EVs are capable of inhibiting excessive activation of the UPS and autophagy lysosome pathway, suppressing oxidative stress and inflammatory response, reversing muscle fiber type transformation, effectively delaying hindlimb unloading-induced muscle atrophy and enhancing muscle function. Our study has further advanced the understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying muscle atrophy in weightlessness and has demonstrated the protective effect of hBMSC-EVs on muscle atrophy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217851322

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their exosomes (Exo) have shown significant therapeutic promise in treating fibrotic conditions. Danshensu (DSS), a bioactive compound from the traditional Chinese herb Danshen reverses fibrosis. This study aims to investigate a novel strategy to enhance the therapeutic efficacy against PF by DSS preconditioning MSCs-derived exosomes (DSS-Exo). Methods: The in vitro studies included the effects of DSS duration on MSCs, and the characterization of DSS-Exo and Exo, followed by the assessment of RNA and protein expression levels of peritoneal fibrosis markers and inflammatory cytokines levels after treating human peritoneal mesothelial (HMrSV5) cells. In vivo experiments were conducted on a PF mouse model to observe cell morphology, collagen deposition, fibrosis localization, and to evaluate peritoneal functions such as filtration rate, urea nitrogen clearance, peritoneal thickness, and protein leakage. Mechanistic insights were gained through the analysis of the STAT3/HIF-1α/VEGF signaling pathway, tissue dual-fluorescence localization,chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and dual-luciferase reporter (DLR) assays. Additionally, the differential expression of miRNAs between DSS-Exo and Exo was explored and validation of key miRNA. Results: DSS-Exo significantly upregulated E-cadherin, downregulated VEGFA, α-SMA, CTGF and Fibronectin expression in HMrSV5 cells compared to untreated Exo. In vivo studies revealed that DSS-Exo enhanced the ability of Exo to improve peritoneal function,such as the peritoneal filtration rate and urea nitrogen, glucose clearance, while reducing peritoneal thickness and protein leakage, and cell morphology, reduce collagen deposition, and decrease the degree of fibrosis. Mechanistically, these exosomes inhibited the STAT3/HIF-1α/VEGF signaling pathway within peritoneal mesothelial tissues. Furthermore, ChIP-seq and DLR demonstrated that DSS-Exo affected STAT3 directly binds to SHANK2 promoter regions, forming hydrogen bonds between 5 key amino acids such as GLN-344, HIS-332 and 6 key bases such as DG-258, DG-261. miRNA profiling identified DSS-Exo increased hsa-miR-27a-5p_R-1 to regulated STAT3-SHANK2 and modulating the EMT. Conclusion: This study highlighted the innovative use of Danshensu in enhancing MSC-derived exosome therapy for PF. The identification of the hsa-miR-27a-5p_R-1-STAT3-SHANK2 axis may reveal new molecular mechanisms underlying fibrosis, further research is needed to fully elucidate its impact on PF.

Although the role of alveolar macrophages (AMs) in stabilizing pulmonary homeostasis is well established, the effects of circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) on AMs remain largely unknown. In this study, an investigation was conducted to map the miRNA and protein expression profiles of EVs derived from septic plasma. Notably, EV-based panels (miR-122-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-223-3p, OLFM4, and LCN2) have been found to be associated with the severity or prognosis of sepsis, with promising AUC values. Moreover, the levels of LCN2, miR-122-5p, and miR-223-3p were identified as independent predictors of septic ARDS. The in vitro coculture results revealed that the effects of LPS-EVs from the plasma of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI), which carry pro-inflammatory EVs, were partly mediated by miR-223-3p, as evidenced by the promotion of inflammation, autophagy and ferroptosis in AMs. Mechanistically, the upregulation of miR-223-3p in LPS-EVs triggers autophagy and ferroptosis in AMs by activating Hippo signaling via the targeting of MEF2C. In vivo, the inhibition of miR-223-3p effectively mitigated LPS-EV-induced inflammation and AM death in the lungs, as well as histological lesions. Overall, miR-223-3p in LPS-EVs contributes to sepsis-induced ALI by priming AMs for autophagy and ferroptosis through the MEF2C/Hippo signaling pathway. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of plasma-AM interaction in sepsis-induced ALI, offering a plausible strategy for assessing septic progression and treating lung injury. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217839336

Among proposed hypotheses on IUA development, the reduced endometrial regeneration resulting from loss of functional stem cells has been proposed as the key factor affecting the IUA prognosis. However, the underlying mechanisms mostly remain unclear. Because the eMSCs (endometrial mesenchymal stem/stromal cells) play a critical role in both supporting the gland development and also preparing the environment for embryo implantation through decidualization, the characteristics and functions were compared between the eMSCs derived from IUA and non-IUA patients, to uncover the important roles of eMSCs in IUA and also the underlying mechanisms. Methods: Endometrium biopsies were collected from IUA patients and controls. The fibrosis features and eMSC distributions were investigated with IHC (immunohistochemistry). Then the eMSCs were isolated and their functions and characteristics were analyzed in vitro. Results: Our results indicate that the scar tissues in IUA are characterized with hyper-activation of pro-fibrotic fibroblast and myo-differentiation, along with reduced number of eMSCs. The isolated eMSCs from IUA and controls show similar functions from the perspectives of cell morphology, proliferation, colony formation, exosome secretion, positive ratio of eMSC markers and conventional MSC markers, tri-differentiation efficiency, the ability of suppressing lymphocyte proliferation, cell aging, and promoting vascular tube formation. However, the eMSCs from IUA have reduced levels of decidualization and higher levels of cell migration, invasion, and also myofibroblast differentiation. Further investigations indicate that the TGF-β pathway, which is the major inducer of myofibroblast differentiation, is up-regulated and responsible for the enhanced myofibroblast differentiation potential of eMSCs from IUA. Conclusions: In conclusion, we have demonstrated here that the scar tissues in IUA biopsy are characterized with enhanced differentiation of pro-fibrotic fibroblast and myofibroblast. The number of eMSCs is reduced in IUA tissues, and their myofibroblast differentiation capability is increased. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217833501

These genes produce proteins that regulate mTORC1 activity, essential for cell function and metabolism. While mTOR inhibitors have advanced treatment, maintaining long-term therapeutic success is still challenging. For over 20 years, significant progress has linked TSC1 or TSC2 gene mutations in stem cells to tuberous sclerosis complex symptoms. Methods: A comprehensive review was conducted using databases like Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct, with search terms such as “tuberous sclerosis complex,” “TSC1,” “TSC2,” “stem cell,” “proliferation,” and “differentiation.” Relevant literature was thoroughly analyzed and summarized to present an updated analysis of the TSC1-TSC2 complex’s role in stem cell fate determination and its implications for tuberous sclerosis complex. Results: The TSC1-TSC2 complex plays a crucial role in various stem cells, such as neural, germline, nephron progenitor, intestinal, hematopoietic, and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells, primarily through the mTOR signaling pathway. Conclusions: This review aims shed light on the role of the TSC1-TSC2 complex in stem cell fate, its impact on health and disease, and potential new treatments for tuberous sclerosis complex. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217832750

Recent studies have indicated that mitochondria play a more crucial role in hair loss than previously recognized. This review summarizes the connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and hair follicle development, outlines the links between diseases related to mitochondrial disorders and hair issues, and highlights the influence of mitochondrial dysfunction on androgenetic alopecia. We discuss the cellular and signaling mechanisms associated with hair loss and examine how mitochondrial dysfunction, such as insufficient energy supply, signaling irregularities, protein/gene abnormalities, and programmed cell death, can hinder the normal proliferation, differentiation, and growth of hair follicle cells. Furthermore, we discuss current treatment approaches and potential innovative therapies, including mitochondrion-targeting drugs and advanced techniques that directly target hair follicle cells, providing fresh insights into the crucial role of mitochondria in maintaining hair follicle health and managing hair disorders. Furthermore, this review explores future therapeutic strategies and proposes that mitochondrial research could lead to groundbreaking treatments for hair loss, thus providing optimism and new avenues for the treatment of individuals experiencing hair loss. This review not only underscores the central importance of mitochondria in hair health but also emphasizes the importance of advancing research and treatment in this field. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217828787

These cells possess a high capacity for self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. Because of these traits, they represent promising sources for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and clinical applications. The objective of this study was to assess the extrinsic and intrinsic factors influencing DPSC characteristics and their potential in tissue engineering. This review discusses the external and internal factors affecting DPSC properties, including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and gene expression post extraction. Additionally, it explores the impact of the microenvironment—its composition and physical properties—and genetic and epigenetic regulation on DPSC behavior. Variations in the microenvironment and genetic regulation play pivotal roles in modulating DPSC functions, including their proliferation and differentiation potential. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors are key barriers to realizing the full therapeutic potential of DPSCs. A deeper understanding of the extrinsic and intrinsic factors affecting DPSC behavior is critical for optimizing their use in regenerative medicine, particularly for dental and craniofacial applications. Although DPSCs hold significant promise, challenges remain, and this review provides insights into the current limitations and future directions for DPSC-based therapies.

A large amount of literature shows that high-altitude TBI is associated with more severe neurological impairments and higher mortality rates compared to low-altitude TBI, due to the special environment of high-altitude hypoxia. However, the role of high-altitude hypoxia in the pathogenesis of TBI remains unclear. In order to deeply investigate this scientific issue, we constructed a high-altitude hypoxic TBI model at different altitudes and used animal behavioral assessments (Modified neurological severity score, rotarod test, elevated plus maze test) as well as histopathological analyses (brain gross specimens, brain water content, Evans blue content, hypoxia inducible factor-1α, Hematoxylin-Eosin staining and ROS detection) to reveal its underlying principles and characteristics. We found that with higher altitude, TBI-induced neurological deficits were more severe and the associated histopathological changes were more significant. Single-nuclear RNA sequencing was subsequently employed to further reveal differential gene expression profiles in high-altitude TBI. We found a significant increase in ferroptosis of astrocytes in cases of high-altitude TBI compared to those at low-altitude TBI. Analyzing transcription factors in depth, we found that Bach1 plays a crucial role in regulating key molecules that induce ferroptosis in astrocytes following high-altitude TBI. Down-regulation of Bach1 can effectively alleviate high-altitude TBI-induced neurological deficits and histopathological changes in mice. In conclusion, high-altitude hypoxia may significantly enhance the ferroptosis of astrocytes and aggravate TBI by up-regulating Bach1 expression. Our study provides a theoretical foundation for further understanding of the mechanism of high-altitude hypoxic TBI and targeted intervention therapy.

This study aims to explore the molecular mechanism by which classical dendritic cells (cDC1s) influence CD8+ T cell expansion in SCI. Methods: Peripheral blood samples from patients with SCI and spinal cord tissues from SCI mice were collected, and the population of cDC1 subset was analyzed by flow cytometry. In vivo, the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) inhibitor quizartinib was administered to deplete cDC1s, while intraperitoneal injection of recombinant Flt3L and immunosuppressive drug FTY-720 was used to expand cDC1s and prevent T cell egress from lymph nodes (LNs), respectively. In vitro, the conditioned medium (CM) of isolated LN fibroblastic stromal cells (FSCs) and pre-DCs were co-cultured. Subsequently, FSC CM-induced DCs were stimulated and co-cultured with CD8+ T cells for proliferation assay. Results: The cDC1 subset was increased in the peripheral blood of SCI patients and in the injured spinal cord of SCI mice. Depletion of cDC1s decreased the proportion of infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the injured spinal cord of SCI mice and reduced the inflammatory response. The Basso Mouse Scale score of SCI mice was increased and the proportion of CD8+ T cells in blood and spinal cord tissue was decreased after FTY-720 injection. Both migratory cDC1s (CD103+) and resident cDC1s (CD8α+) were present in the LNs surrounding the injured spinal cord of SCI mice. Among them, CD103+ cells were derived from the migration of cDC1s in spinal cord tissues, and CD8α+ cDC1s were directionally differentiated from pre-DCs after co-culture with LN-FSCs. Interferon-γ promoted the secretion of Flt3L by LN-FSCs through the activation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway and enhanced the differentiation of pre-DCs into CD8α+ cells. Conclusion: Migratory cDC1s and resident cDC1s promote the expansion of CD8+ T cells in LNs around the injured spinal cord and mediate the adaptive immune response to aggravate neuroinflammation in SCI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217737476

This study investigated the effect of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) isolated from umbilical cord blood and human umbilical cord plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (UCB-EVs) on wound healing and scar formation reduction. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) was used to study the effects of MSC-EVs and UCB-EVs on the heterogeneity of major cell types and wound healing pathways in mouse skin tissue. MSC-EVs and UCB-EVs were isolated using ultracentrifugation and identified using transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and western blot. The effects of MSC-EVs and UCB-EVs on human dermal fibroblast-adult cell (HDF-a) migration and proliferation were evaluated using cell scratch assays, cell migration assays, and cell proliferation assays. In vivo, MSC-EVs and UCB-EVs were injected around full-cut wounds to evaluate their efficacy of wound healing by measuring wound closure rates and scar width and performing histological analysis. ST was performed on skin tissue samples from mice in each group after wound healing to analyze the heterogeneity of major cell types compared with the control group and investigate potential mechanisms affecting wound healing and scar formation. In vitro experiments demonstrated that MSC-EVs and UCB-EVs promoted the proliferation and migration of HDF-a cells. Local injection of MSC-EVs and UCB-EVs into the periphery of a mouse skin wound accelerated re-epithelialization, promoted wound healing, and reduced scar width. ST analysis of skin tissue from each group after wound healing revealed that MSC-EVs and UCB-EVs reduced the relative expression of marker genes in myofibroblasts, regulated wound healing, and decreased scar formation by reducing the expression of the TGF-β signaling pathway and increasing the expression of the Wnt signaling pathway. The results suggest that MSC-EVs and UCB-EVs play a significant role in the activity of cord blood plasma-derived mesenchymal stem cells and cord blood plasma.

Here, we examine how hypoxia and IL-1β act in synergy to augment maladaptive proximal tubular epithelial cell (PTEC) repair in human CKD. Ex vivo patient-derived PTECs were cultured under normoxic (21% O<inf>2</inf>) or hypoxic (1% O<inf>2</inf>) conditions in the absence or presence of IL-1β and examined for maladaptive repair signatures. Hypoxic PTECs incubated with IL-1β displayed a discrete transcriptomic profile distinct from PTECs cultured under hypoxia alone, IL-1β alone or under normoxia. Hypoxia+IL-1β-treated PTECs had 692 ‘unique’ differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to normoxic PTECs, with ‘cell cycle’ the most significantly enriched KEGG pathway based on ‘unique’ down-regulated DEGs (including CCNA2, CCNB1 and CCNB2). Hypoxia+IL-1β-treated PTECs displayed signatures of cellular senescence, with reduced proliferation, G2/M cell cycle arrest, increased p21 expression, elevated senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity and increased production of pro-inflammatory/fibrotic senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors compared to normoxic conditions. Treatment of Hypoxia+IL-1β-treated PTECs with either a type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI) neutralizing antibody or a senolytic drug combination, quercetin+dasatinib, attenuated senescent cell burden. In vitro findings were validated in human CKD bio-specimens (kidney tissue, urine), with elevated PTEC IL-1RI expression and senescence (SA-β-gal activity) detected in fibrotic kidneys and numbers of senescent (SA-β-gal+) urinary PTECs correlating with urinary IL-1β levels and severity of interstitial fibrosis. Our data identify a mechanism whereby hypoxia in combination with IL-1β/IL-1RI signalling trigger PTEC senescence, providing novel therapeutic and diagnostic check-points for restoring tubular regeneration in human CKD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217731927

Phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) plays an essential role in regulating the activation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), while Nrf2 regulates ferroptosis. However, it is still unknown whether PDE4B is involved in the development of IDD. In this study, we explored the role of PDE4B on ferroptosis and Nrf2 in IDD pathogenesis by in vivo and in vitro experiments. The findings suggested that the expressions of PDE4B, ASCL4, and TRFC were significantly upregulated, and the expression of Nrf2 was significantly downregulated in nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues from human IDD patients dependent on IDD degeneration. Overexpression of PDE4B (PDE4B-OE) in NP cells upregulated the expression of ASCL4 and TRFC, and downregulated the expression of Nrf2. Meanwhile, the level of cytokine and oxidative stress were upregulated. Ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1 or Nrf2 activator dimethyl fumarate (DMF) suppressed the effect of PDE4B-OE, while ferroptosis inducer elastin enhanced the effect of PDE4B-OE. In the IDD rat model, PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast, ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1, or Nrf2 activator dimethyl fumarate (DMF) delayed IDD pathogenesis. While administration of ferroptosis inducer elastin enhanced IDD pathogenesis. Combination with PDE4B inhibitor and ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1 significantly synergistic reversed IDD pathogenesis. While combination with PDE4B inhibitor or Nrf2 activator and elastin also decreased the degree of the IDD. The IHC suggested PDE4 inhibitor downregulated the expression of ASCL4 and TRFC. However, the combination effect of the Nrf2 activator was not obvious. Our study suggested that aberrant PDE4B activation in NP tissues induces pathological changes in IDD mediated by ferroptosis, and PDE4 inhibitor reveres the process of IDD by suppressing ferroptosis, and has a synergic effect with ferroptosis inhibitor. So PDE4B inhibition may be a potential therapeutic strategy for IDD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217731913

Multivariable analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to evaluate the association between COVID-19 stressor impact and changes in HR-QoL, and compare it between Ireland and Québec. 405 participants were included from both settings (Ireland n = 267; Québec n = 138). The average HR-QoL improved from the COVID-19 pandemic to post-pandemic, and there were no differences between Ireland and Québec. Women with high COVID-19 stressor impact (18.9% of participants) had a significantly smaller improvement in their overall HR-QoL compared to those with low COVID-19 stressor impact, and this was evident in Ireland (p < 0.004) and Québec (p < 0.0001) but there were no significant differences between Ireland and Québec (interaction p-value > 0.05). Overall, HR-QoL for women with BC improved from pandemic to post-pandemic period. However, similarly in both settings, women who experienced higher levels of COVID-19-related stress had a slower recovery in HR-QoL. These results can guide decisions about health services and policies to adequately address the on-going effect of the pandemic and also prepare for future health crises. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217731911

Clinicians aim to restore organ function, rather than prevent diseases that are prone to sepsis, resulting in high mortality and a heavy public health burden. Some chronic diseases can induce sepsis through inflammation cascade reaction and Cytokine Storm (CS). Interleukin (IL)-6, the core of CS, and its related signaling pathways have been considered as contributors to sepsis. Therefore, it is important to study the relationship between IL-6 and its related pathways in sepsis-related chronic diseases. This review generalized the mechanism of sepsis-related chronic diseases via IL-6 related pathways with the purpose to take rational management for these diseases. IL-6 related signaling pathways were sought in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and retrieved protein-protein interaction in the Search for Interaction Genes tool (STRING). In PubMed and Google Scholar, the studies were searched out, which correlating to IL-6 related pathways and associating with the pathological process of sepsis. Focused on the interactions of sepsis and IL-6 related pathways, some chronic diseases have been studied for association with sepsis, containing insulin resistance, Alcoholic liver disease (ALD), Alzheimer disease (AD), and atherosclerosis. This article summarized the inflammatory mechanisms of IL-6 cross-talked with other mediators of some chronic diseases in vitro, animal models, and human experiments, leading to the activation of pathways and accelerating the progression of sepsis. The clinicians should be highlight to this kind of diseases and more clinical trials are needed to provide more reliable theoretical basis for health policy formulation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217731607

Different insecticides are used for the management of H. armigera, but these insecticides have significantly reduced the effectiveness of T. chilonis. Therefore, this research aims to understand the compatibility of the selected insecticides with biological control strategies involving T. chilonis for managing Helicoverpa armigera in tomato-growing areas. For this purpose, the effects of five insecticides namely Novaluron, Bifenthrin, Emamectin Benzoate, Chlorantraniliprole and Imidacloprid were assessed against T. chilonis under laboratory conditions. The assays involved direct applications of different insecticides on Sitotroga cerealella eggs and their subsequent effect of T. chilonis life history parameters. A total of 200 eggs were used in each treatment. The results revealed that all the tested insecticides had subsequent negative effects on T. chilonis performance. The results showed that the insecticides Imidacloprid and Chlorantraniliprole led to low mean fecundity, minimum number of male and female adults emergence and prolonged the total pre-oviposition period of T. chilonis as compared to Bifenthrin and Novaluron. The bootstrap results recorded the highest value of the net reproductive rate (R<inf>0</inf>), intrinsic rate of increase (r) and the finite rate of increase (λ) of T. chilonis in host eggs treated with Bifenthrin and Novaluron as compared to the other tested chemicals. The results regarding percent parasitism showed that maximum percent parasitism was noted in control, Bifenthrin and Novaluron, while the insecticides Imidacloprid and Chlorantraniliprole resulted in minimum % parasitism (63.5% and 71%) respectively. The study revealed that Bifenthrin and Novaluron are relatively more compatible with the T. chilonis in the different integrated pest management programs for H. armigera as compared to other tested chemicals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217731597

Emerging evidence underscores the therapeutic promise of exosomes in osteoarthritis management. Nonetheless, challenges such as low yields and insignificant efficacy of current exosome therapies necessitate significant advances. Addressing lower strontium (Sr) levels in arthritic synovial microenvironment, we studied the effect of Sr element on exosomes and miRNA selectively loading in synovial mesenchymal stem cells (SMSCs). Here, we developed an optimized system that boosts the yield of SMSC-derived exosomes (SMSC-EXOs) and improves their miRNA profiles with an elevated proportion of beneficial miRNAs, while reducing harmful ones by pretreating SMSCs with Sr. Compared to untreated SMSC-EXOs, Sr-pretreated SMSC-derived exosomes (Sr-SMSC-EXOs) demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy by mitigating chondrocyte ferroptosis and reducing osteoclast-mediated joint pain in TMJOA. Our results illustrate Alix’s crucial role in Sr-triggered miRNA loading, identifying miR-143-3p as a key anti-TMJOA exosomal component. Interestingly, this system is specifically oriented towards synovium-derived stem cells. The insight into trace element-driven, site-specific miRNA selectively loading in SMSC-EXOs proposes a promising therapeutic enhancement strategy for TMJOA. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217731590

The development of therapeutic strategies that combine anti-inflammatory effects and cartilage repair mechanisms holds great promise for effective RA treatment. To address the limitations associated with the off-target effects of intravenous administration and the risk of synovial cavity infection with repeated local injections, we have innovatively developed a liposomal drug depot through hyaluronic acid (HA)-modified liposomes encapsulating dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP)-loaded nanogels, termed HA-Lipo@G/D. The nanogels were prepared by ionic cross-linking of chondroitin sulfate and gelatin, both of which have notable cartilage repair properties. In vitro studies demonstrated that this formulation exhibited sustained drug release, enhanced uptake by inflammatory macrophages, reduced secretion of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β), and significantly decreased chondrocyte apoptosis induced by inflammatory factors. Moreover, in vivo assessments in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis revealed effective accumulation of the liposomal drug depot at the inflamed joint site, resulting in macrophage repolarization and cartilage tissue repair. Our findings provide a synergistic strategy for inhibiting inflammation and mitigating cartilage damage through local joint cavity injection, thereby enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of RA. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217731491

Emerging evidence indicates that senescent cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly contribute to cancer progression and metastasis. Although the influence of senescence on SARC has been partially acknowledged, it has yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we revealed that senescence level and age were associated with TME, immune treatment indicators, and prognosis in SARC. Utilizing the weighted gene co-expression network analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm, we identified senescence-related genes and developed a senescence predictor. Three genes, RAD54, PIK3IP1, and TRIP13, were selected to construct a multiple linear regression model. Validation cohorts, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed that the predictor derived from these three genes possessed prognostic and pathological relevance. Our senescence predictor provides comprehensive insights into the molecular mechanisms of SARC and identifies potential biomarkers for prognosis, paving the way for effective treatments. The results of this study hold promise for developing therapeutic strategies tailored to the unique characteristics of SARC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217663349

Their curriculum includes important topics in Geriatric medicine. As they undertake a 2-year intensive postgraduate course we wanted to explore if Team-based Learning is an effective and efficient learning strategy. In addition, we wanted to know how this approach compares to their current learning methods, namely Problem-based learning and lectures. Methods: This was a qualitative study of Physician associate student perceptions of Team-Based Learning. After introducing four TBL sessions in the specialty of Geriatric medicine we sent students anonymous questionnaires asking them about their TBL experience and how it compared to PBL and lectures. We then undertook a thematic analysis of the responses. Results: Twenty students responded to our online questionnaire. The thematic analysis utilised themes from previous studies as well as emergent ones. The key themes were that TBL requires more preparation, TBL is effective, TBL is preferred to PBL and lectures, but students did not want TBL to replace all their teaching. Conclusions: TBL is an effective learning strategy that can be used alongside other teaching methods. While Physician Associate students preferred TBL over PBL and lectures, they wanted to have TBL alongside lectures at least.

Natural killer (NK) cell play an important role in tumor immune surveillance. The aim of this study was to explore the possible molecular mechanisms involved in NK cell in THCA to help the management and treatment of the disease. Methods: All data were downloaded from public databases. Candidate hub genes associated with NK cell in THCA were identified by limma, WGCNA and singleR packages. Functional enrichment analysis was performed on the candidate hub genes. Hub genes associated with NK cell were identified by Pearson correlation analysis. The mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA and transcription factors (TF) networks were constructed and the drug was predicted. Results: The infiltration level of NK cell in THCA tissues was higher than that in paracancerous tissues. KEGG functional enrichment analysis only obtained two signaling pathways, thyroid hormone synthesis and mineral absorption. CTSC, FN1, SLC34A2 and TMSB4X identified by Pearson correlation analysis were considered as the hub genes. Receiver operating characteristic analysis suggested that hub genes may be potential diagnostic biomarkers. In mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA network, FN1 had the highest correlation with IQCH-AS1, and IQCH-AS1 was also correlated with hsa-miR-543. In addition, FN1 and RUNX1 were also found to have the highest correlation in TF network. Finally, NK cell-related drugs belinostat and vorinostat were identified based on ASGARD. Conclusion: The identification of important signaling pathways, molecules and drugs provides potential research directions for further research in THCA and contributes to the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this disease. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217625697

While newer techniques like organoids and assembloids have shown improvements, they still remain inadequate in addressing all research needs. In this study, we present a new method for maintaining the prostate gland of the earthworm, Eudrilus eugeniae ex vivo and examine its potential for regeneration and drug screening. We successfully maintained the earthworm prostate gland in cell culture media for over 200 days, with observed beating behavior confirming its viability. Apoptotic staining and histological analysis show no significant changes, indicating that the prostate gland remains stable. However, significant overexpression of H3 and H2AX on the 10th and 50th days suggests stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Alkaline phosphatase expression analysis confirmed that the stem cell niche is localized to the anterior region. Remarkably, the posterior region of the prostate gland demonstrated significant regenerative capacity, with complete regeneration occurring within 45 days following amputation. Furthermore, treatment with valproic acid enhanced posterior regeneration, leading to full restoration within 12 days.

Objective: The current study aimed to investigate the association of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) as well as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) expressions in serum and femoral head (FH) tissues with NT-ONFH’s severity. Methods: We enrolled NT-ONFH patients (n = 150) alongside healthy controls (HCs, n = 150). Meanwhile, 49 patients with femoral neck fracture (FNF) were also enrolled. Serum CHOP and GRP78 levels were determined through enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Local CHOP and GRP78 expressions were detected by immunohistochemistry, western blot, alongside real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Radiographic severity was assessed by FICAT grading system. The visual analogue scale (VAS) together with Harris hip score (HHS) were utilized to determine symptomatic severity. Results: Serum CHOP and GRP78 levels were markedly increased in NT-ONFH patients than HCs. NT-ONFH patients at FICAT stage 4 showed significant higher serum CHOP and GRP78 levels in contrast with those at stage 3. Furthermore, patients at stage 3 demonstrated higher serum CHOP and GRP78 levels than those at stage 2. There was a positive correlation observed between the serum CHOP and GRP78 levels and the severity of the FICAT stages. A total of 42 ONFH patients at FICAT stage 3, 40 patients at FICAT stage 4, and 49 FNF patients received total hip replacement (THR). The mRNA and protein levels of CHOP and GRP78 were elevated in necrotic area compared to the non-necrotic area of ONFH patients and the FH tissues of FNF patients with statistical significance. The expression levels of CHOP and GRP78 within the local tissues were significantly elevated in patients at FICAT stage 4 as opposed to those at stage 3. Besides, ROC curve analysis indicated that serum and local CHOP and GRP78 expressions may act as indicators of disease progression. The levels of CHOP and GRP78, both in serum and at the local site, were in a positive correlation with VAS scores but an inverse relationship with HHS.

Understanding these underlying mechanisms is crucial for developing effective therapeutic approaches. Here we show the role of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in bone lesions induced by myeloma cells. Our research reveals that cytokines produced by myeloma-associated adipocytes activate the expression of EZH2 in myeloma cells. Furthermore, we find that EZH2 forms a transcriptional repression complex with transcription factor AP2α. This complex promotes trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) in the promoter region of the tumor suppressor gene EMP1, resulting in transcriptional silencing. EMP1 silencing leads to increased myeloma cell proliferation and the concomitant secretion of osteolytic cytokines that contribute to bone destruction. Importantly, EZH2 inhibitors effectively treat myeloma-induced osteolytic lesions. Thus, targeting EZH2 represents a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing and managing myeloma bone disease. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217623797

There is a substantial global burden of disease and mortality attributable to skin defects that do not heal. About 1% to 2% of the population in industrialized nations suffers from chronic wounds that don't heal, despite healthcare breakthroughs; this condition is very costly, costing about $25 billion each year in the US alone. Amputation, infection (affecting as many as 25% of chronic wounds), sepsis, and dermal replacements are all consequences of conventional therapeutic approaches like growth factor therapy and diabetic foot ulcers account for 85% of lower limb amputations. Despite these obstacles, scientists are constantly looking for new ways to speed healing and close wounds. The unique immunomodulatory capabilities and multipotency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have made them a potential therapeutic choice in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Animal models of wound healing have shown that MSCs can speed up the process by as much as 40% through enhancing angiogenesis, modulating inflammation, and promoting fibroblast migration. Clinical trials provide more evidence of their effectiveness; for instance, one RCT found that, after 12 weeks, patients treated with MSCs had a 72% smaller wound size than those in the control group. This review offers a thorough examination of MSCs by combining the latest research with preclinical evidence. Highlighting their potential to transform treatment paradigms, it delves into their biological properties, how they work during regeneration and healing, and therapeutic usefulness in controlling chronic wounds. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217623548

The distinct honeycombing patterns observed in computed tomography (CT) for the primary diagnosis of PF are typically only visible in patients with moderate to severe disease, often leading to missed opportunities for early intervention. In this study, we developed a nanoprobe designed to accumulate at fibroblastic foci and loaded with the CT sensitizer iodide to enable effective early diagnosis of PF. An antibody fragment (Fab′) targeting the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α, which specifically binds to (myo)fibroblasts, was conjugated to the nanoprobe surface to enhance targeting of fibroblastic foci. Additionally, collagenase was employed to facilitate nanoprobe penetration by degrading the local collagen fibers within these foci. This approach led to significant accumulation of the CT sensitizer iodide in fibrotic lung tissues, resulting in enhanced CT imaging for the detection of fibroblastic foci and enabling early diagnosis of PF. Moreover, a dual-drug combination of oltipraz and rosiglitazone was co-loaded into the nanoparticles for the treatment of early-diagnosed PF. Remarkable therapeutic efficacy was observed in model mice with early PF using these nanoparticles. Our findings present a promising strategy for the early diagnosis of PF, potentially offering a valuable time window for effective treatment of this life-threatening disease. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217621417

Since recent evidence underlines the epigenetic role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in the management of these comorbidities, this study compared the effects of these agents, namely liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide, and exenatide, on miRNA regulation in the management of T2DM. Results: GLP-1RAs modify the expression of miRNAs involved in endothelial function, sugar metabolism, and adipogenesis, including but not limited to miR-27b, miR-130a, and miR-210. Baseline miR-15a-5p predict weight loss, while higher miR-378-3p and miR-126-3p levels are related to better glycemic control and lower HbA1c and FPG at one year post-treatment. miR-375-5p was also reported as a predictor of HbA1c levels. Liraglutide has a protecting effect against pancreatic β-cell apoptosis by downregulating miR-139-5p. The highly-expressed miR-375 in pancreatic islets can be considered as a biomarker for assessing the cytoprotective action of GLP-1RAs on β-cells. GLP-1RAs also enhance β-cell responsiveness by promoting GLP-1 receptor expression through the suppression of miR-204. While semaglutide, semaglutide, and dulaglutide reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, lixisenatide and exenatide QW did not reveal such an effect. The long-acting exenatide-induced miR-29b-3p is required for the protection against diabetic cardiomyopathy. Liraglutide modulates critical regulators of endothelial cell function and atherosclerosis, including miR-93-5p, miR-26a-5p, and miR-181a-5p. Eventually, GLP-1RAs regulation of exosomal miRNAs, such as miR-192, implicated in the development of fibrosis and inflammation in T2DM micro-cardiovascular outcomes like DKD and DR. Conclusion: Additional studies will be needed in the elucidation of the relations between GLP-1RA-induced miRNAs and clinical-laboratory findings concerning the diverse populations, gender, and presence of other comorbid states in treated patients with T2DM. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217557600

CAFs are pivotal in the tumor microenvironment (TME) molding, and exert a profound influence on tumor development. The origin and roles of CAFs, however, are still unclear in the HNSCC, especially antigen-presenting cancer-associated fibroblasts (apCAFs). Our current study tried to explore the origin, mechanism, and function of the apCAFs in the HNSCC. Data from single-cell transcriptomics elucidated the presence of apCAFs in the HNSCC. Leveraging cell trajectory and Cellchat analysis along with robust lineage-tracing assays revealed that apCAFs were primarily derived from myeloid cells. This transdifferentiation was propelled by the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which was secreted by tumor cells and activated the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. Analysis of the TCGA database has revealed that markers of apCAFs were inversely correlated with survival rates in patients with HNSCC. In vivo experiments have demonstrated that apCAFs could facilitate tumor progression. Furthermore, apCAFs could modulate ratio of CD4+ T cells/CD8+ T cells, such as higher ratio of CD4+ T cells/CD8+ T cells could promote tumor progression. Most importantly, data from in vivo assays revealed that inhibitors of MIF and p-STAT3 could significantly inhibit the OSCC growth. Therefore, our findings show potential innovative therapeutic approaches for the HNSCC.

Cellular senescence, a known anti-tumour mechanism, has been observed in several types of cancer. However, the regulatory interplay of circRNAs with cellular senescence in pancreatic cancer (PC) is still unknown. Therefore, we identified circHIF-1α, hsa_circ_0007976, which was downregulated in senescent cells using circRNA microarray analysis. Meanwhile, significantly upregulated expression of circHIF-1α in pancreatic cancer tissue detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH). High circHIF-1α expression levels were found to independently predict poor survival outcomes. Subsequent treatments with DOX and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> resulted in significantly lower levels of circHIF-1α. CircHIF-1α knockdown induces cellular senescence and suppresses PC proliferation in vitro experiments. The ability of circHIF-1α knockdown to suppress the progression of PC cells was further confirmed in vivo experiments. Our results showed that circHIF-1α is mainly presented in the nucleus of PC cells, also in the cytoplasm. Mechanistically, circHIF-1α inhibited senescence and accelerated the progression of PC cells through miR-375 sponging, thereby promoting HIF-1α expression levels. Nuclear circHIF-1α interacted with human antigen R protein (HUR) to increase HIF-1α expression. Thus, our results demonstrated that circHIF-1α ameliorates senescence and exacerbates growth in PC cells by increasing HIF-1α through targeting miR-375 and HUR, suggesting that targeting circHIF-1α offers a potential therapeutic candidate for PC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217496561

WRN is known to protect somatic cells including adult stem cells from premature senescence. Loss of WRN in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) not only drives the cells to premature senescence but also significantly impairs the function of the stem cells in tissue repair or regeneration. Results: In this study, we profiled the signaling pathways altered in WRN-deficient MSC and applied pharmacological method to activate the AKT signaling in these cells and examined their cellular phenotype related to aging. We found that the AKT signaling in WRN-deficient MSCs was significantly suppressed while the AKT upstream phosphatases (SHIP1/2) were upregulated. Knockdown or inhibition of SHIP1/2 could ameliorate premature senescence in WRN-deficient MSCs. Moreover, SHIP inhibition stimulated MSC proliferation and suppressed expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. The stemness of WRN-deficient MSC was also improved upon pharmacological treatments with the inhibitors. Conclusions: These results suggested that targeting the SHIP/AKT signaling pathway is beneficial to WRN-deficient stem cells and fibroblasts, which might be applied for improving the trophic function of MSC in, for instance, promoting angiogenesis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217451253

Therefore, examining breast tissue is crucial in accurately identifying and treating this disease. Exosomes are very small enclosures bounded by a layer of cells and produced by a variety of cells present in the cancerous tissue surroundings. They play a crucial role in several biological functions in cancerous tumors. These exosomes carry non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and are discharged into the TME, where they are instrumental in the development and advancement of tumors. Additionally, the ncRNAs enclosed in exosomes act as significant mediators of communication within cells. Consequently, there is limited comprehension regarding the precise roles and targets of exosomal RNA in regulation, as research in this area is still in its preliminary phases. This piece provides a comprehensive overview of the latest studies on exosomes, delving into their impact on the behavior of cancer cells and immune cells. Moreover, it presents a compilation of the diverse forms of non-coding RNA molecules found in exosomes released by both cancerous and supportive cells, including circular RNAs, microRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs. Current research has proven the noteworthy influence that non-coding RNA molecules have on the progression, proliferation, drug resistance, and immune responses of breast cancer cells. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217434605

Cytokines, small signaling molecules, significantly influence immune responses during and post-liver transplantation. Nonetheless, the intricate relationships among cytokines, immune responses, and the gut microbiota, especially gut dysbiosis, are still inadequately comprehended. Thus, this study aims to identify the gut microbiota (GM) and determine their relationship to cytokines (IL-17 and IL-10) in LT patients, due to their importance in enhancing the recovery rate. Result: The research included 31 liver transplant (LT) patients from the Gastroenterology Surgical Center at Mansoura University, resulting in the collection of 174 stool and blood samples from all participants. Fourteen bacterial species have been identified in samples collected at three intervals: one week before, one week post, and two weeks post LT. A change in gut microbiota composition was noted, characterized by a rise in potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Enterococci and Enterobacteriaceae (including Escherichia coli and Klebsiella) and a reduction in beneficial bacteria such as Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. The examination of patient demographic and clinical data revealed no significant correlations between sex, age, or diagnostic categories and gut microbiota composition. The findings of the Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) indicated a substantial effect of gut microbiota composition on cytokine levels (IL-10 and IL-17), with all tests producing p-values of 0.001. The assessment of cytokine levels indicated fluctuating variations at several time points following surgery. IL-10 levels in the GM groups exhibited a statistically significant elevation during the second week post-surgery (p = 0.036), suggesting a potential recovery-related anti-inflammatory response. In contrast, IL-17 levels rose in the NI group over time, indicating a transition to a pro-inflammatory condition. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the pivotal role of the gut microbiota in regulating immune responses following transplantation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217357899

The conversion of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts is known to play a critical role in HS formation, making it essential to identify molecules that promote myofibroblast dedifferentiation and to elucidate their underlying mechanisms. In this study, we used comparative transcriptomics and single-cell sequencing to identify key molecules and pathways that mediate fibrosis and myofibroblast transdifferentiation. Epidermal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EpiSC-EVs) were isolated via ultracentrifugation and filtration, followed by miRNA sequencing to identify miRNAs targeting key molecules. After in vitro and in vivo treatment with EpiSC-EVs, we assessed antifibrotic effects through scratch assays, collagen contraction assays, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Transcriptomic sequencing and rescue experiments were used to investigate the molecular mechanism by which miR-203a-3p in EpiSC-EVs induces myofibroblast dedifferentiation. Our results indicate that PIK3CA is overexpressed in HS tissues and positively correlates with fibrosis. EpiSC-EVs were absorbed by scar-derived fibroblasts, promoting dedifferentiation from myofibroblasts to quiescent fibroblasts. Mechanistically, miR-203a-3p in EpiSC-EVs plays an essential role in inhibiting PIK3CA expression and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway hyperactivation, thereby reducing scar formation. In vivo studies confirmed that EpiSC-EVs attenuate excessive scarring through the miR-203a-3p/PIK3CA axis, suggesting EpiSC-EVs as a promising therapeutic approach for HS. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217357863

This is caused by the abnormal activation of pancreatic enzymes by a variety of etiologic factors, which results in a localized inflammatory response. The symptoms of this disease include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting and fever. These symptoms are induced by a hyperinflammatory response and oxidative stress. In recent years, research has focused on developing anti-inflammatory and antioxidative therapies for the treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP). However, there are still limitations to this approach, including poor drug stability, low bioavailability and a short half-life. The advent of nanotechnology has opened up a novel avenue for the management of acute pancreatitis (AP). Nanomaterials can serve as an efficacious vehicle for conventional pharmaceuticals, enhancing their targeting ability, improving bioavailability and prolonging their half-life. Moreover, they can also exert a direct therapeutic effect. This review begins by introducing the general situation of acute pancreatitis (AP). It then discusses the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis (AP) and the current status of treatment. Finally, it considers the literature related to the treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP) by nanomaterials. The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature on the use of nanomaterials in the treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP). In particular, the changes in inflammatory markers and therapeutic outcomes following the administration of nanomaterials are examined.

Extracellular signals drive cell proliferation during tissue regeneration, while epigenetic mechanisms regulate stem cell homeostasis, differentiation, and skin repair. Exploring epigenetic regulation in adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) holds promise for improving skin injury treatments. We investigated the effects of histone deacetylase inhibitor (SAHA) on ADSCs to better understand its cellular and molecular impacts. ADSCs were treated with SAHA for 72 h, showing no change in cell viability at the studied concentrations. However, the expression of histone deacetylase decreased at 1000 nM, while the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 increased after SAHA treatment, as confirmed by immunofluorescence. CCND1 gene expression increased, whereas protein expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) decreased. Cell cycle analysis showed an increase in G2 phase in SAHA-treated cells. Microarray analysis revealed 74 upregulated and 40 downregulated differentially expressed genes, including upregulation of P53 targets, CDKN1A and MDM2. Proteomic analysis identified 631 upregulated and 823 downregulated proteins compared to the vehicle. Pathway enrichment analysis showed cell cycle, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and DNA processes were among the affected pathways.

Tumor heterogeneity due to the acquisition of new somatic alterations leads to a high rate of resistance to current therapies or reduces the efficacy of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), thus increasing the risk of relapse and mortality. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) will enable the classification of AML and guide treatment approaches by profiling patients with different facets of the same disease, stratifying risk, and identifying new potential therapeutic targets at the time of diagnosis or after treatment. ScRNA-seq allows the identification of quiescent stem-like cells, and leukemia stem cells responsible for resistance to therapeutic approaches and relapse after treatment. This method also introduces the factors and mechanisms that enhance the efficacy of the HSCT process. Generated data of the transcriptional profile of the AML could even allow the development of cancer vaccines and CAR T-cell therapies while saving valuable time and alleviating dangerous side effects of chemotherapy and HSCT in vivo.

Their influence on the synthesis and processing of messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, and transfer RNA allows m7G modifications to affect diverse cellular, physiological, and pathological processes. m7G modifications are pivotal in human diseases, particularly cancer progression. On one hand, m7G modification-associated modulate tumour progression and affect malignant biological characteristics, including sustained proliferation signalling, resistance to cell death, activation of invasion and metastasis, reprogramming of energy metabolism, genome instability, and immune evasion. This suggests that they may be novel therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.

A progressive decline of excretory kidney function has effects on body homeostasis. CKD is tightly associated with accelerated cardiovascular disease and severe infections, and with premature death. Kidney failure without access to kidney replacement therapy is fatal — a reality in many regions of the world. CKD can be the consequence of a single cause, but CKD in adults frequently relates rather to sequential injuries accumulating over the life course or to the presence of concomitant risk factors. The shared pathomechanism of CKD progression is the irreversible loss of kidney cells or nephrons together with haemodynamic and metabolic overload of the remaining nephrons, leading to further loss of kidney cells or nephrons. The management of patients with CKD focuses on early detection and on controlling all modifiable risk factors. This approach includes reducing the overload of the remaining nephrons with inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system and the sodium-glucose transporter 2, as well as disease-specific drug interventions, if available. Hypertension, anaemia, metabolic acidosis and secondary hyperparathyroidism contribute to cardiovascular morbidity and reduced quality of life, and require diagnosis and treatment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217357303

However, their utility in treating diabetes-associated atherosclerosis remains largely unexplored. Here, we aimed to characterize BMSC-EV-mediated regulation of autophagy and macrophage polarization. Methods: EVs were isolated from the supernatant of cultured BMSCs and characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and western blotting. A diabetes-related atherosclerotic ApoE−/− mouse model was established through feeding with a high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ). Histopathological analyses were carried out using Oil Red O, H&E, and Masson staining of the aorta. TEM and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were applied to evaluate autophagy, and immunofluorescence (IF) was used to identify macrophage polarization. RAW264.7 macrophages were induced with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and high glucose (HG), co-cultured with BMSC-EVs, and analyzed for macrophage proliferation, migration, and foam cell formation. RAW264.7 cells were transduced with autophagy marker mRFP-GFP-LC3 lentivirus and analyzed with IF and western blotting. Results: Diabetic mice (DA group) had larger aortic plaque areas and lower collagen content than the HFD mice. BMSC-EV treatment significantly reduced blood glucose, LDL levels, and aortic plaque areas while increasing collagen content. BMSC-EV-treated aortas contained a higher number of autophagosomes/autolysosomes, with increased expression of LC3BII correlating with decreased P62 levels and a lower proportion of M1 macrophages. In vitro, BMSC-EVs inhibited proliferation, migration, and foam cell formation in ox-LDL and HG-induced activated RAW264.7 cells. These effects were reversed by the autophagy blocker bafilomycin A1. Consistent with the in vivo findings, BMSC-EVs elevated levels of the autophagy-related protein LC3BII/I and decreased P62 in ox-LDL and HG-induced RAW264.7 cells. These cells also expressed the M1 macrophage markers CD86 and iNOS, but showed reduced expression of the M2 marker Arg-1. Further, BMSC-EVs decreased AMPKα and mTOR phosphorylation levels, which were blocked by the AMPK inhibitor compound C. Conclusions: BMSC-EVs attenuate diabetes-exacerbated atherosclerosis by inhibiting vascular macrophage proliferation, migration, and foam cell formation via AMPK/mTOR signaling-regulated autophagy and macrophage polarization. BMSC-EVs thus hold promise as therapeutic agents for atherosclerosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217357259

Circular RNA (circRNA) serves as a biomarker in RA blood samples. This research screened differentially expressed circRNAs in RA patient plasma exosomes for novel diagnostic biomarkers. In this study, samples of RA patients with insufficient response to methotrexate (MTX-IR), combined use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) were followed up for half a year, and 56 circRNA samples of self-test data were stratified into training, testing, and external validation cohorts according to whether American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20) was achieved. A diagnostic xgboost model was developed using common hub genes identified by random forest and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), with intersection genes derived from overlapping machine learning-selected genes. Diagnostic performance evaluated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using pROC for area under the curve (AUC). Optimal LASSO model with 4 circRNAs determined, with AUC > 0.6 for key genes. The model validation performed well on the test set, but not significantly on the validation set. Then, circRNA screening was performed in combination with clinical data, and cross-validation identified hsa-circ0002715, hsa-circ0001946, hsa-circ0000836, and rheumatoid factor (RF) as key genes, among which hsa-circ0002715 and hsa-circ0001946 were emphasized as key markers on the training set. In addition, the morphology and size of exosomes and the expression of CD9 and CD81 verified the successful extraction of exosomes. The qPCR analysis of plasma exosomes in TNFi patients found that the expression of hsa-circ0002715 was higher than that in patients who didn’t reach ACR20, and the expression of hsa-circ0001946 was lower than that in patients who didn’t reach ACR20. The above studies suggested that hsa-circ0002715 and hsa-circ0001946 may become markers for predicting MTX-IR RA patients and TNFi precision treatment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217357149

A range of PEEK composite materials, including sulfonated polyether ether ketone (SPEEK), polydopamine-sulfonated polyether ether ketone (SPEEK-PDA), bone-forming peptide-poly-dopamine-sulfonated polyether ether ketone (SPEEK-PDA-BFP), and vascular endothelial growth factor-poly-dopamine-sulfonated polyether ether ketone (SPEEK-PDA-VEGF), were constructed by concentrated sulfuric acid sulfonation, polydopamine modification and grafting of bioactive factors. The experiments involved adult male New Zealand rabbits aged 24–28 weeks and weighing 2.6–4 kg. The SPEEK-PDA-BFP possesses the smallest water contact angle, indicating the highest hydrophilicity, with its surface characterized by a rich density of clustered BFP particles. The SPEEK-PDA-BFP exhibits superior adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation capabilities, along with pronounced bacteriostatic effects, which are attributed to its dense particle clusters. The SPEEK-PDA-BFP facilitates the formation of regular and dense bone trabeculae. Comparative study on treating osteonecrosis with SPEEK-PDA-VEGF and SPEEK-PDA-BFP highlighted the superior formation of mature bone trabeculae and angiogenic protein CD31 around SPEEK-PDA-VEGF. The PEEK composite materials have good biocompatibility, osteogenic activity and bone repair activity. In particular, SPEEK-PDA-VEGF composite materials have the best effect on bone repair. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217357091

This paper reports the development and refinement of Witness Project® Lung, a community-based initiative tailored to the specific needs of the Black community, aiming to improve awareness and engagement with lung cancer screening. Methods: Utilizing a user-centered design and guided by the original Witness Project® framework – an evidence-based lay health advisor intervention program originally developed to increase knowledge and awareness about breast cancer risk and screening in the Black community and later trans-created to the cervical and colorectal cancer screening contexts - Witness Project® Lung was developed and refined through qualitative input from key stakeholders in the Black faith community. Guided by the PEN-3 model and the Conceptual Model for Lung Cancer Screening Participation, the program underwent a rigorous development process to ensure cultural relevance and was pilot tested in the New York City metropolitan area in faith-based and community-based organizational sites in the Black community. Results: Pilot testing conducted in New York and New Jersey demonstrated high acceptability, satisfaction, and increased knowledge among participants. The community-based approach, culturally sensitive messaging, and partnerships with faith-based organizations were critical to the refinements of Witness Project® to Witness Project® Lung. The program’s focus on addressing social determinants of health and its delivery by trained lay health advisors showcased feasibility and potential effectiveness. Witness Project® Lung presents a promising alternative to traditional health system-based interventions for improving lung screening rates among Black Americans. Conclusions: The community-based, culturally tailored approach, coupled with the involvement of trusted community leaders, has the potential to reduce disparities in lung cancer outcomes. Further research is needed to assess the long-term impact and cost-effectiveness of Witness Project® Lung in promoting lung screening uptake and improving health outcomes within underserved populations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217356984

Despite advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, the impact of the tumour microenvironment, particularly extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness, on CRC progression and metastasis is not fully understood. Methods: This study included 107 CRC patients. Tumour stiffness was assessed using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), and collagen ratio was analysed with Masson staining. CRC cell lines were cultured on matrices of varying stiffness, followed by transcriptome sequencing to identify stiffness-related genes. An HSF4 knockout CRC cell model was cultured in different ECM stiffness to evaluate the effects of HSF4 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Results: CRC tumour stiffness was significantly higher than normal tissue and positively correlated with collagen content and TNM staging. High-stiffness matrices significantly regulated cell functions and signalling pathways. High HSF4 (heat shock transcriptional factor 4) expression was strongly associated with tumour stiffness and poor prognosis. HSF4 expression increased with higher TNM stages, and its knockout significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, especially on high-stiffness matrices. In vivo experiments confirmed that HSF4 promoted tumour growth and metastasis, independent of collagen protein increase. Conclusions: This study reveals that tumour stiffness promotes the proliferation and metastasis of CRC by regulating EMT-related signalling pathways through HSF4. Tumour stiffness and HSF4 could be valuable targets for prognostic assessment and therapeutic intervention in CRC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217356896

Here, we demonstrate that equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 and 2 (ENT1 and 2, encoded by SLC29A1 and 2) drive cellular nicotinamide uptake and establish nicotinamide metabolism homeostasis. In addition, ENT1/2 exhibits a strong capacity to change the cellular metabolite composition and the transcript, especially those related to nicotinamide. We further observe that ENT1/2 regulates cellular respiration and senescence, contributing by altering the NAD+ pool level and mitochondrial status. Changes to cellular respiration, mitochondrial status and senescence by ENT1/2 knockdown are reversed by NMN supplementation. Together, ENT1 and ENT2 act as both cellular nicotinamide-level keepers and nicotinamide biological regulators through their NAM transport functions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217356874

However, despite the promising regenerative properties documented in preclinical studies, for instance in osteoarthritis (OA), the therapeutic translation of these results in patients has not been fully conclusive. One factor contributing to this therapeutic barrier could be the presence of senescent cells in OA joints. Methods: This study evaluated a novel approach to OA treatment by combining adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AD-MSCs) with rapamycin, a clinically approved immunosuppressive drug with anti-senescence properties. First, rapamycin effects on senescence and fibrosis markers were investigated in freshly isolated OA chondrocytes by immunostaining. Next, the in vitro differentiation capacities of AD-MSCs, their regulatory immune functions on activated immune cells and their regenerative effects on OA chondrocyte signature were assessed in the presence of rapamycin. Results: In OA chondrocytes, rapamycin reduced the senescence marker p15INK4B and the fibrosis marker COL1A1 without affecting the expression of the master chondrogenic markers SOX9 and COL2. Rapamycin also enhanced AD-MSC differentiation into chondrocytes and reduced their differentiation into adipocytes. In addition, rapamycin improved AD-MSC immunoregulatory functions by promoting the expression of immunosuppressive factors, such as IDO1, PTGS2 and also CD274 (encoding PD-L1). Finally, RNA sequencing analysis showed that in the presence of rapamycin, AD-MSCs displayed improved chondroprotective regenerative effects on co-cultured OA chondrocytes.

There is great evidence indicating that tumor microenvironment is characterized by high lactate levels, acting not only as an energetic source, but also as a signaling molecule. Methods: To test the involvement of lactate in MF milieu transformation, we measured its levels in MF patients’ sera, eventually finding a massive accumulation of this metabolite, which we showed to promote the expansion of immunosuppressive subsets. Therefore, to assess the significance of its trafficking, we inhibited monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) by its selective antagonist, AZD3965, eventually finding a mitigation of lactate-mediated immunosuppressive subsets expansion. To further dig into the impact of lactate in tumor microenvironment, we evaluated the effect of this metabolite on mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) reprogramming. Results: Our results show an activation of a cancer-associated phenotype (CAF) related to mineralized matrix formation and early fibrosis development. Strikingly, MF serum, enriched in lactate, causes a strong deposition of collagen in healthy stromal cells, which was restrained by AZD3965. To corroborate these outcomes, we therefore generated for the first time a TPOhigh zebrafish model for the establishment of experimental fibrosis. By adopting this model, we were able to unveil a remarkable increase in lactate concentration and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) expression in the site of hematopoiesis, associated with a strong downregulation of lactate export channel MCT4. Notably, exploiting MCTs expression in biopsy specimens from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, we found a loss of MCT4 expression in PMF, corroborating changes in MCT expression during BM fibrosis establishment. Conclusions: In conclusion, our results unveil lactate as a key regulator of immune escape and BM fibrotic transformation in MF patients, suggesting MCT1 blocking as a novel antifibrotic strategy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217274625

However, approximately 35% of patients still experience myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, which contributing to increased AMI mortality. Therefore, an accurate understanding of myocardial I/R injury is important for preventing and treating AMI. The death of each cell (cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiac fibroblasts, and mesenchymal stem cells) after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion is associated with apoptosis due to mitochondrial dysfunction. Abnormal opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, aberrant mitochondrial membrane potential, Ca2+ overload, mitochondrial fission, and mitophagy can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby inducing mitochondrial apoptosis. The manifestation of mitochondrial apoptosis varies according to cell type.

We hypothesised that transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) alone induces a pro-fibrotic effect similar to FC. Our aim was to compare the pro-fibrotic effects of TGF-β1 with FC in human precision-cut lung slices (PCLS). Methods: PCLS from “healthy” lung tissue of cancer patients undergoing surgery (n = 7) were incubated with TGF-β1, FC or control for 72 h. Gene expression markers for myofibroblasts differentiation, extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as TGF-β receptors were assessed (RT-qPCR). ECM proteins expression in lysates and supernatant was assessed by ELISA and immunofluorescence. Results: We found that TGF-β1 significantly increased gene expression of ACTA2, COL1A1, CCN2, and VIM compared to control but also compared to FC. FC showed a significant increase of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 7 and 1 compared to control, while TGF-β receptor 2 was lower after FC compared to TGF-β1 or control. FC or TGF-β1 showed similar fibronectin protein expression in lysates and supernatants, while type I collagen protein expression in lysates was significantly greater with TGF-β1 compared to control. Conclusions: Our findings show that TGF-β1 induces consistent pro-fibrotic changes in PCLS after 72 h. Compared to TGF-β1, FC treatment resulted in reduced gene expression of TGF-β receptor 2 and increased MMPs expression, potentially mitigating the early pro-fibrotic effects. Selecting specific pro-fibrotic stimuli may be preferable depending on the research question and time point of interest in lung fibrosis studies using PCLS. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Letter,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217273744

The combination of PD-1 inhibitors and CAR-T has shown encouraging results in treating patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, there are still cases where treatment is ineffective. This study aimed to investigate the role of IL4I1 in the poor efficacy of CD19 CAR-T combined with PD-1 inhibitors in R/R DLBCL and to explore potential mechanisms. Transcriptomic and metabolomic correlation analyses were performed on tumor tissue from DLBCL patients. We employed an in vitro co-culture system consisting of Pfeiffer cells, CD19 CAR-T and macrophages to investigate the underlying mechanisms. It was found that IL4I1 levels were significantly increased in the tumor tissues of R/R DLBCL patients compared to responders. Correlation analysis revealed a positive association between IL4I1 and tryptophan (Trp)-kynurenic acid (Kyn) related metabolites. In the in vitro co-culture model, the presence of IL4I1 inhibited the cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells. Depletion of IL4I1 disrupted the IDO-AHR-Kyn signaling pathway, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of PD-1 inhibitors in combination with CD19 CAR-T for DLBCL treatment. CAR-T-mediated cytotoxicity was significantly inhibited when IL4I1 was present in the in vitro co-culture model. These findings suggest that IL4I1 may be a contributing factor to poor prognosis in R/R DLBCL patients. IL4I1 expression enhances immunosuppression via the IDO-AHR-Kyn pathway, inhibiting the effectiveness of PD-1 inhibitors combined with CD19 CAR-T. Therefore, suppression of IL4I1 may represent a potential target for combination therapy in DLBCL. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217273668

Nanoparticles have emerged as promising tools in cancer detection, diagnosis, and prevention. In this study, the antitumor and apoptotic capability of silver nanoparticles synthesized through Scrophularia striata extract (AgNPs-SSE) was investigated toward breast cancer cells. Methods: The produced AgNPs-SSE were identified using scanning electron micrograph (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The cell-killing effects of AgNPs-SSE on MDA-MB231 mammary carcinoma cells were evaluated in vitro using the MTT assay over 24 h. Apoptosis induction was conducted by cell cycle analysis, annexin V-FITC/PI staining, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and Hoechst staining. Additionally, the gene expression of βcatenin, GSK3β, and CyclinD1 was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Results: Microscopic analysis confirmed the successful fabrication of globular AgNPs-SSE, with a mean particle dimension of 19 ± 10 nm. The MTT assay revealed that IC<inf>50</inf> value of AgNPs-SSE was 48.5 µg/mL for mammary carcinoma cells and 114 µg/mL for normal cells. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining specified that 85.88% of cancer cells treated with AgNPs-SSE underwent either early or late apoptosis. Treatment with AgNPs-SSE also caused a considerable rise in the subG1 cell cycle population and ROS production. Furthermore, the upregulation of βcatenin and downregulation of CyclinD1 gene expression confirmed the apoptotic mechanism. Conclusions: In conclusion, the findings suggest that phyto-synthesized AgNPs-SSE can restrain the expansion of breast carcinoma cells and provoke apoptosis through oxidative stress. These results highlight the potential of AgNPs-SSE as an antitumor agent against breast cancer. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217273271

However, few studies have reported the relationship between hyponatremia at admission and outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT). This study is aimed to explore the association between hyponatremia and clinical outcomes following MT. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted at our center. The primary outcome was postoperative malignant brain edema (MBE). The secondary outcomes included mortality and adverse function at the 90-day follow-up, which were defined as modified Rankin scale scores of 6 and > 2, respectively. Patients were classified into hyponatremia and nonhyponatremia groups based on their serum sodium concentration at admission before drug use. The occurrence of MBE was evaluated via computed tomography after MT, and 90-day outcomes were obtained through in-person interviews at the clinic or via telephone. Multivariate analysis was performed to investigate the associations among postoperative MBE, 90-day mortality, adverse function and hyponatremia. Results: A total of 342 patients were enrolled into the study, of whom 52 (15.2%) had hyponatremia, 86 (25.1%) developed postoperative MBE, 93 (27.2%) died within 90 days after MT, and 201 (58.8%) had adverse functions at the 90-day follow-up. Multivariate analysis revealed that hyponatremia was significantly associated with postoperative MBE (odds ratio [OR] 3.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66 − 9.23, p = 0.002), 90-day mortality (OR 5.49, 95% CI 2.48 − 12.14, p < 0.001), and 90-day adverse function (OR 3.25, 95% CI 1.29 − 8.12, p = 0.012). In addition, mediation analysis revealed that postoperative MBE may partially account for the 90-day mortality/adverse function of patients with hyponatremia (regression coefficients changed by 18.6% and 23.9%, respectively). Conclusion: Hyponatremia is an independent predictor of postoperative MBE, 90-day mortality, and adverse function.

We previously reported the protective effect of VEGFR3 in salt-sensitive hypertension. However, the specific mechanism underlying the role of VEGFR3 in kidney during the overactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system remains unclear. In the present study, hypertensive nephropathy was established by angiotensin II (Ang II). We found that VEGFR3 was highly increased in PTCs of Ang II-infused mice. Activation of VEGFR3 mitigated renal dysfunction, pathological damage, and oxidative stress in Ang II-induced hypertensive mice. Moreover, we found that VEGFR3 restored mitophagy deficiency induced by Ang II both in vivo and in vitro to alleviate oxidative stress injury in PTCs. Furthermore, in vitro experiment demonstrated that VEGFR3 improved abnormal mitophagy by enhancing PARKIN mitochondrial translocation. LC-MS/MS and Co-IP assays identified HSPA1L as the interacted protein of VEGFR3, which promoted the mitochondrial translocation of PARKIN. Mechanistically, VEGFR3 disorder domain bound to HSPA1L, and crotonylation modification of HSPA1L at K130 by VEGFR3 was required for mitophagy regulation in the context of Ang II-induced PTCs. Finally, the protective effect of VEGFR3 on mitophagy and oxidative stress were attenuated by transfection K130 (HSPA1L-K130R) mutant plasmid in vivo and in vitro. These findings indicated that VEGFR3 alleviated oxidative stress by promoting PARKIN-dependent mitophagy pathway via regulating HSPA1L crotonylation at K130 site in Ang II-induced PTCs, which provided a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic target in hypertensive renal injury. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217272871

This study investigates the effects of prenatal BPA exposure on neural stem cells (NSCs) from the hippocampi of rat offspring, a brain region critical for neurodevelopment and implicated in ASD. Pregnant rats were administered with BPA or vehicle control once daily via oral gavage from gestational day 1 until parturition. NSCs were isolated from the offspring’s hippocampi on postnatal day 1, and RNA sequencing was performed to examine transcriptomic alterations. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified through RNA-seq and further analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to explore disrupted pathways. In addition, in vitro proliferation assays were conducted, utilizing immunofluorescence staining for Sox2, a stem cell marker, and BrdU to quantify proliferating NSCs. Our results revealed that prenatal BPA exposure induced sex-specific alterations in NSC gene expression, with ASD-related genes such as Atp1a3, Nefl, and Grin1 being particularly dysregulated in male offspring. Moreover, sex-specific changes in NSC proliferation were observed. The study underscores BPA’s potential as an environmental risk factor for ASD, emphasizing the need for further research into its role in sex-specific neurodevelopmental effects. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217272072

However, the exact mechanism of IVDD associated with ferroptosis still required deeper studies. Method: The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in rat lumbar disc tissue between the control and IVDD group treated with IL-1β were detected by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were performed on DEGs. We further screened the differential expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DEFRGs). Besides, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEFRGs was constructed by STRING database. The Cytoscape database identified significant modules and the hub genes. The loss function of PDK4 by siRNA inference was investigated in NPCs by CCK8 assay, ELISA assay, and the analysis of ferroptosis indicators. Result: DEGs were identified using RNA-seq. KEGG pathway analysis showed that these genes were mainly involved in Parkinson’s disease, oxytocin signaling pathway, calcium ion signaling pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, and glucagon signaling pathway. Eight hub genes (including LDHA, PKM, EP300, EGFR, EGLN1, SCD, PDK4, and FABP4) were found by the PPI network and Cytoscape on a total of 25 ferroptosis-related genes that were identified in rat lumbar disc tissue after IVDD treatment. PDK4 silencing promoted NPCS proliferation, decreased the levels of the proinflammatory factors, and suppressed ferroptosis. Conclusion: The study suggested the potential roles of ferroptosis-related genes in IVDD and further revealed the role of PDK4 in the progression of IVDD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217272056

LncRNA NEAT1 is considered as a proliferative inhibitory role during cellular senescence, but the relevant mechanisms remain insufficient. This study aims to elucidate how NEAT1 regulates mitotic proteins during BMSCs aging. Methods: BMSCs were isolated from alveolar bone of human volunteers aged 26–33 (young) and 66–78 (aged). NEAT1 expression and distribution changes during aging process were observed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice or human BMSCs. Subsequent RNA pulldown and proteomic analyses, along with single-cell analysis, immunofluorescence, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), were conducted to investigate that NEAT1 impairs the nuclear transport of mitotic FGF2 and contributes to BMSCs aging. Results: We reveal that NEAT1 undergoes significant upregulated and shifts from nucleus to cytoplasm in bone marrow and BMSCs during aging process. In which, the expression correlates with nuclear DNA content during karyokinesis, suggesting a link to mitogenic factor. Within NEAT1 knockdown, hallmarks of cellular aging, including senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), p16, and p21, were significantly downregulated. RNA pulldown and proteomic analyses further identify NEAT1 involved in osteoblast differentiation, mitotic cell cycle, and ribosome biogenesis, highlighting its role in maintaining BMSCs differentiation and proliferation. Notably, as an essential growth factor of BMSCs, Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) directly abundant binds to NEAT1 and the sites enriched with nuclear localization motifs. Importantly, NEAT1 decreased the interaction between FGF2 and Karyopherin Subunit Beta 1 (KPNB1), influencing the nuclear transport of mitogenic FGF2. Conclusions: Our findings position NEAT1 as a critical regulator of mitogenic protein networks that govern BMSC aging. Targeting NEAT1 might offer novel therapeutic strategies to rejuvenate aged BMSCs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217271719

Herein, we proposed a novel approach to modulate the inflammation through metabolic remodeling, thus promoting dry eye recovery. Our study demonstrated that co-treatment with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and thymosin beta-4 (Tβ4) yielded the best therapeutic outcome against dry eye, surpassing monotherapy outcomes. In situ metabolomics through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) revealed increased glutamine levels in cornea following MSC + Tβ4 combined therapy. Inhibition of glutamine reversed the anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and homeostasis-preserving effects observed with combined therapy, highlighting the critical role of glutamine in dry eye therapy. Clinical cases and rodent model showed elevated expression of glutaminase (GLS1), an upstream enzyme in glutamine metabolism, following dry eye injury. Mechanistic studies indicated that overexpression and inhibition of GLS1 counteracted and enhanced, respectively, the anti-inflammatory effects of combined therapy, underscoring GLS1’s pivotal role in regulating glutamine metabolism. Furthermore, single-cell sequencing revealed a distinct subset of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic corneal epithelial cells in the dry eye model, while glutamine treatment downregulated those subclusters, thereby reducing their inflammatory cytokine secretion. In summary, glutamine effectively ameliorated inflammation and the occurrence of apoptosis by downregulating the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic corneal epithelial cells subclusters and the related IκBα/NF-κB signaling. The present study suggests that glutamine metabolism plays a critical, previously unrecognized role in DED and proposes an attractive strategy to enhance glutamine metabolism by inhibiting the enzyme GLS1 and thus alleviating inflammation-driven DED progression. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217271679

Wogonoside is a natural flavonoid extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis with a variety of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic, and cardiac function improvement properties. Despite these known effects, the specific role of wogonoside in the context of atherosclerosis remains to be elucidated. Purpose: To validate the efficacy of wogonoside in the treatment of atherosclerosis and to investigate its possible therapeutic mechanisms. Methods: Network pharmacology was used to obtain the core targets and signaling pathways that may be efficacious in the treatment of atherosclerosis with wogonoside, which were validated using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. To further validate the core targets in the signaling pathway, we performed in vivo experiments using apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-/- mice. This included pathological morphology and lipid deposition analysis of mouse aorta, serum lipid level analysis, Elisa analysis, oxidative stress analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) fluorescence assay, immunohistochemical analysis and protein blot analysis. Results: Predictions were obtained that wogonoside treatment of atherosclerosis has 31 core targets, which are mainly focused on pathways such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway and NF-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that wogonoside has good binding properties to the core targets. In vivo experimental results showed that wogonoside significantly inhibited aortic inflammatory response and lipid deposition, significantly reduced the release levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), oxidized low density (ox-LDL) and free fatty acid (FFA), and significantly inhibited the release of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and oxidative stress in ApoE-/- mice. Further molecular mechanism studies showed that wogonoside significantly inhibited the activation of TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in ApoE-/- mice. Conclusion: Wogonoside may be an effective drug monomer for the treatment of atherosclerosis, and its mechanism of action is closely related to the inhibition of the activation of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217190447

Bioinformatics analysis revealed that pyroptosis and inflammatory responses induced by spared nerve injury (SNI) in the spinal dorsal horn play a critical role in the initiation and persistence of neuropathic pain. Among the factors involved, TSPO (translocator protein) emerged as a key regulator. Our experimental findings showed that TSPO expression was upregulated during neuropathic pain, accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, specifically manifested as impaired mitochondrial biogenesis, disrupted mitochondrial dynamics (including insufficient expression of mitochondrial biogenesis and fusion-related proteins, as well as significantly increased expression of fission-related proteins), and activation of pyroptosis. Pharmacological upregulation of TSPO, but not its downregulation, effectively alleviated SNI-induced pain hypersensitivity, improving mitochondrial function and reducing pyroptosis. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that TSPO was primarily localized in astrocytes, and its expression mirrored the protective effects on mitochondrial health and pyroptosis prevention. PCR array analysis suggested a strong association between TSPO and the mitochondrial regulation pathway AMPK-PGC-1α. Notably, inhibition of AMPK-PGC-1α abolished TSPO effects on mitochondrial balance and pyroptosis suppression. Furthermore, Mendelian randomization analysis of GWAS data indicated that increased TSPO expression was linked to pain relief. Through drug screening, molecular docking, and behavioral assays, we identified zopiclone as a promising TSPO-targeting drug for pain treatment. In summary, this study enhances our understanding of the molecular interplay between TSPO, mitochondrial health, and neuropathic pain, highlighting TSPO as a potential therapeutic target for pain management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217190430

Important pathologic characteristics of IVDD include inflammation and acidic microenvironment, albeit it is unclear how these factors contribute to the disease. Purpose: To clarify the functions of inflammation and the acidic environment in IVDD, identify the critical connections facilitating glycolytic crosstalk and nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) pyroptosis, and offer novel approaches to IVDD prevention and therapy. Methods: By developing keywords search strategy, literature was found and screened using databases such as PUBMED, Google Scholar, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and others. Hub genes, protein interaction networks, clinical transcriptome data validation, and enrichment analysis were used to further validate relevant biological pathways. Results: It is clear that disc degeneration is associated with apoptosis or pyroptosis, inflammation, and an acidic environment based on literature review. The process of IVDD is intimately associated with pyroptosis, inflammation, and an acidic environment. The precise mechanism may entail the regulation of key genes such NLRP3, ASIC1a, IL1β, TNF-a, and GSDMD. While the acidic environment exacerbated extracellular matrix degradation and promoted cellular senescence and inflammatory factor expression, it was found to be unfavorable for NPCs survival and proliferation. Moreover, NPCs pyroptosis in an acidic environment, the molecular mechanism behind this phenomenon may be connected to ASIC1a mediated Ca + influx. On the other hand, IVDD can be constantly promoted by the interaction between the degenerating disc’s acidic and inflammatory environments through “crosstalk” between anaerobic glycolysis and positive feedback. Conclusion: In summary, the inflammatory process in NPCs is made worse by the buildup of glucose brought on by metabolic problems, such as anaerobic glycolytic processes, and pyroptosis caused by excessive glucose may be mitigated by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress. A new therapeutic approach for IVDD will involve using ASIC1a as a regulatory target to enhance the inflammatory environment and decrease the incidence of NPCs pyroptosis. Following this, anaerobic glycolysis will be regulated, lactic acid generation will be reduced, and the degenerative vicious loop will be blocked. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217190295

The mitochondrial impairment in corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells (CCSMCs) may be an important pathological mechanism of CNI-ED. Previous studies have shown that transplantation of human adipose derived stem cells (ADSC) can alleviate CNI-ED in a rat model. However, little is known about the effect of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSC) on CNI-ED. It remains unclear whether hUC-MSC can ameliorate mitochondrial damage in CCSMCs. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impacts of hUC-MSC on the mitochondrial mass and function of CCSMCs, as well as elucidate its underlying molecular mechanism. Methods: The CNI-ED rat model was established by bilaterally crushing cavernous nerves. Subsequently, hUC-MSC were transplanted into the cavernosum and ADSC were injected as a positive control group. Erectile function evaluation and histological detection were performed 4 weeks after cell transplantation. In vitro, CCSMCs underwent hypoxia and were then co-cultured with ADSC or hUC-MSC using a transwell system. The mitochondrial mass and function, as well as signaling pathways, were investigated. To explore the role of the SIRT1/PGC-1α/TFAM pathway in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis of CCSMCs, we knocked down SIRT1 by siRNA. Results: The administration of hUC-MSC significantly improved erectile function of CNI-ED rats and reduced the ratio of collagen to smooth muscle. Specifically, hUC-MSC treatment restored mitochondrial mass and function in CCSMCs injured by CNI or hypoxia, and inhibited the apoptosis of CCSMCs. Mechanistically, the application of hUC-MSC activated SIRT1/PGC-1α/TFAM pathway both in rat penile tissues and CCSMCs. In addition, knockdown of SIRT1 in CCSMCs abolished the protective effects of hUC-MSC on mitochondrial mass and function, while leading to an increase in cellular apoptosis. Conclusions: hUC-MSC contribute to the recovery of erectile function in CNI-ED rats by restoring mitochondrial mass and function of CCSMCs through the SIRT1/PGC-1α/TFAM pathway. Our present study offers new insights into the role and molecular mechanisms of hUC-MSC in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis, thereby facilitating the restoration of the erectile function in CNI-ED. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217189455

The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome within microglia after brain radiation is involved in the progression of RIBI by mediating inflammatory responses. We have previously shown that sulfonylurea receptor 1-transient receptor potential M4 (SUR1-TRPM4) mediates microglial NLRP3-related inflammation following global brain ischemia. However, the role of SUR1-TRPM4 in RIBI remains unclear. Here, we found that whole-brain radiation induced up-regulation and assembly of SUR1-TRPM4, which further activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia and caused persistent neuroinflammation in mice. Blocking SUR1-TRPM4 by glibenclamide or gene deletion of Trpm4 effectively prevented NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation and alleviated RIBI. Utilizing the mouse model of RIBI and irradiated BV2 cells, we further demonstrated that irradiation caused mitochondrial damage to microglia, leading to violent release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which enhanced the transcription of SUR1, TRPM4, and NLRP3 inflammasome-related molecules. Moreover, ROS up-regulated ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) to enhance TRPM4 expression by mediating the demethylation of the gene promoter, thereby facilitating the assembly of SUR1-TRPM4 in microglia. In summary, this study deciphers that SUR1-TRPM4 crucially mediates the persistent activation of microglial NLRP3 inflammasome under the action of ROS after whole-brain radiation, offering novel therapeutic strategies for delayed RIBI as well as other NLRP3-related neurological disorders involving excessive ROS production. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217189217

Heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) regulates oxidative stress, but its role in airway diseases needs exploration. Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healthy nasal mucosa and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) were identified from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Candidate genes were further screened using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. Causal inference between candidate genes and upper and lower airway diseases (CRSwNP, allergic rhinitis (AR), and asthma (AS)) was conducted using bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (TwoSampleMR) analysis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were used to determine the cellular localization and intercellular interactions of candidate genes. Molecular docking was used to identify potential therapeutic agents. Results: HMOX1 expression was significantly elevated in CRSwNP. TwoSampleMR analysis indicated a negative causal relationship between HMOX1 exposure and the occurrence of upper and lower airway diseases (CRSwNP [(odds ratio (OR)/95% confidence interval (CI): 0.945/(0.893–0.999), P = 0.044], AR [OR/95% CI: 0.997/(0.994–0.999), P = 0.007], and AS [OR/95% CI: 0.935/(0.895–0.977), P = 0.003]). scRNA-seq data revealed HMOX1 localization in M2 macrophages. Molecular docking identified 15 antioxidants, including Acetylcysteine and Quercetin, that can upregulate HMOX1 expression. Conclusion: HMOX1 may have a protective role in the pathogenesis of upper and lower airway diseases (CRSwNP, AR, and AS) by modulating oxidative stress. Antioxidants that increase HMOX1 expression could offer new therapeutic avenues for these diseases.

MiRNAs influence gene expression and are carried by extracellular vesicles (EV), affecting cell-cell communication. Aims: (1) Identify the difference in miRNA expression between depressed patients and healthy controls; (2) Analyze associations of these miRNAs with bone turnover markers; (3) Analyze target genes of differentially regulated miRNAs and predict associated pathways regarding depression and bone metabolism. Methods and results: Blood samples from depressed patients (n = 11) were obtained from a previous study and healthy controls (n = 9) were recruited. Sociodemographic, depression diagnosis and depressive symptom (BDI-II) data were collected through questionnaires. Blood plasma was collected from each participant and real-time-quantitative PCR was performed on isolated plasma EVs; differences in miRNA expression between groups were analyzed using qbase+. Regression models assessed the associations of differentially regulated miRNAs with bone turnover markers procollagen-1 N-terminal-peptide, osteocalcin, and crosslaps; enriched pathways and miRNA target gene networks were analyzed. 19 miRNAs were differentially expressed between groups (p < 0.05). MiR-26b-5p and miR-106a-5p showed an association with procollagen-1 N-terminal-peptide; miR-330-5p and miR-377-3p were associated with osteocalcin, and miR-26b-5p, miR-34c-3p and miR-145 with crosslaps. Pathway analysis including the differentially expressed miRNAs predicted enriched pathways, including the FoxO signaling and p53 signaling pathway. Seven target genes were identified. Conclusions: MiRNAs (e.g. miR-26b-5p, miR-377-3p), genes (TNRC6B, HSPA8), and pathways (FoxO- and Hippo-signaling pathway) are identified which could be mediators between the influence of depression on bone health and could possibly serve as biomarkers in the treatment of bone diseases among people with mental disorders. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217147849

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSC) offer a promising cell-free therapeutic strategy, yet their efficacy and immunomodulation can be enhanced through bioactivation. In this study, we developed calcium silicate (CS)-stimulated ADSC-derived EVs (CSEV) incorporated into collagen hydrogels to create a sustained-release system for promoting diabetic wound healing. CSEV exhibited enhanced protein content, surface marker expression, and bioactive cargo enriched with pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory factors. In vitro, CSEV-loaded collagen significantly reduced reactive oxygen species production, promoted cell proliferation and migration compared to standard EV-loaded collagen. Cytokine profiling revealed the upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix components, highlighting their immunomodulatory and regenerative potential. In vivo, histological evaluation of diabetic rabbit models treated with CSEV-loaded collagen revealed superior reepithelialization and organized collagen deposition, indicating accelerated wound closure. These findings underscore the potential of CSEV-loaded collagen hydrogels as an innovative and effective therapeutic platform for enhancing diabetic wound healing by simultaneously addressing inflammation and tissue regeneration. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217120164

During efferocytosis, the metabolic pathways of phagocytes are transformed, which, along with the catabolism of apoptotic cargo, can affect their function and inflammatory state. Extensive apoptosis occurs during placental development, and some studies reported the immunomodulatory effects of efferocytosis at the maternal–fetal interface. The dysregulation of efferocytosis is strongly linked to pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and recurrent spontaneous abortion. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of efferocytosis and its relationships with metabolism and inflammation. We also highlight the roles of professional and non-professional phagocytes in efferocytosis at the maternal–fetal interface and their impact on pregnancy outcomes and explore relevant regulatory factors.

At present, the comparability of urinary proteomics data across diverse liquid chromatography−mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platforms remains an area that requires investigation. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of urinary proteome across multiple LC-MS platforms. To systematically analyze and assess the quality of large-scale urinary proteomics data, we develop a comprehensive quality control (QC) system named MSCohort, which extracted 81 metrics for individual experiment and the whole cohort quality evaluation. Additionally, we present a standard operating procedure (SOP) for high-throughput urinary proteome analysis based on MSCohort QC system. Our study involves 20 LC-MS platforms and reveals that, when combined with a comprehensive QC system and a unified SOP, the data generated by data-independent acquisition (DIA) workflow in urine QC samples exhibit high robustness, sensitivity, and reproducibility across multiple LC-MS platforms. Furthermore, we apply this SOP to hybrid benchmarking samples and clinical colorectal cancer (CRC) urinary proteome including 527 experiments. Across three different LC-MS platforms, the analyses report high quantitative reproducibility and consistent disease patterns.

Mitochondria, the primary powerhouses of the cell, play an integral role in retinal physiology by fulfilling the high-energy requirements of photoreceptors and secondary neurons through oxidative phosphorylation. In a healthy state, mitochondria ensure proper visual function by facilitating efficient conversion and transduction of visual signals. However, in retinal degenerative diseases, mitochondrial dysfunction significantly contributes to disease progression, involving a decline in membrane potential, the occurrence of DNA mutations, increased oxidative stress, and imbalances in quality-control mechanisms. These abnormalities lead to an inadequate energy supply, the exacerbation of oxidative damage, and the activation of cell death pathways, ultimately resulting in neuronal injury and dysfunction in the retina. Mitochondrial transplantation has emerged as a promising strategy for addressing these challenges. This procedure aims to restore metabolic activity and function in compromised cells through the introduction of healthy mitochondria, thereby enhancing the cellular energy production capacity and offering new strategies for the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases. Although mitochondrial transplantation presents operational and safety challenges that require further investigation, it has demonstrated potential for reviving the vitality of retinal neurons.

However, its application has been limited by the complexities of the ischemic microenvironment. Hydrogel scaffolds, which are composed of hyaluronic acid and chitosan, exhibit excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, making them promising candidates as cell carriers. Vascular endothelial growth factor is a crucial regulatory factor for stem cells. Both hyaluronic acid and chitosan have the potential to make the microenvironment more hospitable to transplanted stem cells, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in the context of stroke. Here, we found that vascular endothelial growth factor significantly improved the activity and paracrine function of adipose-derived stem cells. Subsequently, we developed a chitosan-hyaluronic acid hydrogel scaffold that incorporated vascular endothelial growth factor and first injected the scaffold into an animal model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. When loaded with adipose-derived stem cells, this vascular endothelial growth factor-loaded scaffold markedly reduced neuronal apoptosis caused by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation and substantially restored mitochondrial membrane potential and axon morphology. Further in vivo experiments revealed that this vascular endothelial growth factor-loaded hydrogel scaffold facilitated the transplantation of adipose-derived stem cells, leading to a reduction in infarct volume and neuronal apoptosis in a rat model of stroke induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. It also helped maintain mitochondrial integrity and axonal morphology, greatly improving rat motor function and angiogenesis. Therefore, utilizing a hydrogel scaffold loaded with vascular endothelial growth factor as a stem cell delivery system can mitigate the adverse effects of ischemic microenvironment on transplanted stem cells and enhance the therapeutic effect of stem cells in the context of stroke. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217009932

Methods: A total of 152 Patients with advanced gastric cancer who were continuously diagnosed and treated in our hospital were selected as the study objects. The general data were retrospectively analyzed. The patients in the control group received oxaliplatin, while the patients in the study group received capecitabine on the basis of the control group. The FOXP1 expression level was detected using immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of GGT were measured by chemiluminescence. Protein levels were detected by Western blot. The prognostic factors were analyzed by the COX regression model. The Kaplan–Meier survival curve was used to analyze the survival of gastric cancer. Results: The effective rates (complete response, partial response, and stability) of the study group and the control group were 94.74% and 76.32%, respectively. Compared with adjacent normal tissues, the expression level of FOXP1 in gastric cancer tissues was lower (P < 0.05). After treatment, the average expression level of FOXP1 in the gastric cancer tissue of the study group was higher than the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, lower FOXP1 expression was associated with lower overall survival (OS) (1-year survival and 3-year survival were 75.76% and 53.03%, respectively) (P < 0.05). Further analysis showed that capecitabine combined with oxaliplatin down-regulated the expression of DNA repair related-proteins and up-regulated the expression of key molecules of the apoptosis pathway, thus enhancing the killing effect of oxaliplatin on gastric cancer cells (P < 0.05). Both the 1-year and 3-year survival rates of the study group were higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The 1-year survival rate of 152 patients with gastric cancer was 84.87% (129/152) and the 3-year survival rate was 63.17% (96/152). Age, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, lymph node metastasis, chemotherapy regimen, FOXP1, and GGT levels were important factors in determining OS. Conclusion: Capecitabine effectively enhanced the sensitivity of intermediate and advanced gastric cancer to oxaliplatin, improved the therapeutic effect and ameliorated the prognosis of patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217002060

Highly targeted therapies have been developed for different subtypes of breast cancer, including hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. However, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metastatic breast cancer disease are primarily treated with chemotherapy, which improves disease-free and overall survival, but does not offer a curative solution for these aggressive forms of breast cancer. Moreover, the development of chemoresistance is a major cause of therapeutic failure in this neoplasia, leading to disease relapse and patient death. In addition, chemotherapy’s adverse side effects may substantially worsen health-related quality of life. Therefore, to improve the outcome of patients with breast cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy, several therapeutic options are under investigation, including the combination of chemotherapeutic drugs with natural compounds. Omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids, have drawn attention for their antitumoral properties and their preventive activities against chemotherapy-induced toxicities in breast cancer. A literature review was conducted on PubMed using keywords related to breast cancer, omega-3, chemoresistance, and chemotherapy. This review aims to provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms driving breast cancer chemoresistance, focusing on the role of ω-3 PUFAs in these recognized cellular paths and presenting current findings on the effects of ω-3 PUFAs combined with chemotherapeutic drugs in breast cancer management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217002043

Although miR-125b-5p is known to be involved in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders, its function in ox-LDL-induced endothelial injury is still not well understood. Methods: An in vitro AS cell model was established by exposing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to 100 µg/mL ox-LDL for 24 h. A series of functional assays, including CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, MDA and SOD kits, capillary-like network formation assay and ELISA assay were performed in vitro. TNFSF4/TLR4/NF-κB pathway-related protein expressions were measured by Western blot. Molecular mechanisms were elucidated through quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analysis, and luciferase reporter assays. Results: Our investigation revealed that exposure to ox-LDL led to a downregulation in miR-125b-5p, while upregulating the expression of tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 4 (TNFSF4), TLR4, p-p65 and p-IkBa in HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner. We confirmed TNFSF4 as a direct target of miR-125b-5p. Ox-LDL exposure led to decreased cell viability and angiogenic capacity, along with increased apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in HUVECs. These effects were reversed by overexpressing miR-125b-5p or knocking down TNFSF4. Overexpression of TNFSF4 significantly reversed the effects brought about by miR-125b-5p in HUVECs exposed to ox-LDL. Moreover, miR-125b-5p inactivated the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway by negatively regulating TNFSF4. Conclusions: In summary, our findings demonstrate that miR-125b-5p possessed an anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis against ox-LDL-induced HUVEC injury by regulating the TNFSF4/TLR4/NF-κB signaling, indicating that miR-125b-5p may have an important therapeutic function for AS. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217001808

Methods: Patients had MMPRT repair concomitant with PMOWHTO and varus medial knee osteoarthritis without concomitant root tear patients who underwent PMOWHTO and were reviewed. Radiographic parameters, medial meniscus extrusion (MME) and Knee Society Scores [KSSs, including the following subscores: knee score (KS) and knee function score (KFS)] were evaluated. Continious variables are expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR) [IQR: (Q1;Q3); Q1: median of lower half, Q3: median of upper half]. The minimum follow-up period was 24 months [29 (28;35) months]. Results: A total of 36 knees of 34 patients underwent PMOWHTO were included. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of a MMPRT. Nineteen of the 36 knees had MMPRTs, and all of them had concomitant root repair (Group 1). Seventeen of the 36 patients did not have MMPRTs (Group 2). The posterior tibial slope (PTS) decreased postoperatively in a total of 36 knees (p < 0.001). There were no significant changes in MME postoperatively in any intragroup comparison. The preoperative and follow-up MMEs of Group 1 were greater than those of Group 2 (p < 0.001).

Hence, this study was designed to identify predisposing factors for ICUAW and establish a predictive model for the early diagnosis of ICUAW. Methods: This prospective observational multicenter study included septic patients from the comprehensive ICUs of West China Hospital of Sichuan University and 10 other hospitals between September and November 2023. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age over 18 years; expected ICU stay longer than 3 days; and voluntary informed consent. Patients were classified into ICUAW (MRC score < 48) and non-ICUAW (MRC score ≥ 48) groups based on muscle strength assessments. The analyzed key predictive factors encompassed demographic data, SOFA and APACHE II scores, inflammatory markers (PCT, IL-6, and CRP), and ultrasound measurements of muscle thickness and cross-sectional area.

Here, we investigated the role of IL-6 in PM of gastric cancer (GC) and assessed whether anti-IL-6 receptor antibody (anti-IL-6R Ab) could inhibit PM of GC. We conducted immunohistochemical analysis of IL-6 and α-smooth muscle (α-SMA) expressions in clinical samples of GC and PM, and investigated the interactions between CAFs and GC cells in vitro. Anti-tumor effects of anti-IL-6R Ab on PM of GC were investigated in an orthotopic murine PM model. IL-6 expression was significantly correlated with α-SMA expression in clinical samples of GC, and higher IL-6 expression in the primary tumor was associated with poor prognosis of GC. Higher IL-6 and α-SMA expressions were also observed in PM of GC. In vitro, differentiation of fibroblasts into CAFs and chemoresistance were observed in GC cells cocultured with fibroblasts. Anti-IL-6R Ab inhibited the progression of PM in GC cells cocultured with fibroblasts in the orthotopic mouse model but could not inhibit the progression of PM consisting of GC cells alone. IL-6 expression in the TME was associated with poor prognosis of GC, and CAFs were associated with establishment and progression of PM via IL-6. Anti-IL-6R Ab could inhibit PM of GC by the blockade of IL-6 secreted by CAFs, which suggests its therapeutic potential for PM of GC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216998022

Notably, increased serum NIK levels were positively correlated with disease severity and decreased with disease remission. NIK inhibitor B022 significantly reduced B-cell activation, proliferation, ASCs differentiation and pathogenic function, as well as CD4+T cell activation and Th17 cells differentiation in vitro. Intraperitoneal injection of B022 ameliorated the severity of EAMG rats, and reduced proportion of pathogenic B and T cell subsets, antibody levels and postsynaptic membrane damage. Conclusions: Targeting NIK with small molecule kinase inhibitors can effectively shape B cell homeostasis, and exhibit protective effects in the EAMG rat model, which may be an effective novel treatment strategy for MG. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216997681

Seventy-five 8-week-old C57BL/6J female mice underwent ovariectomy, followed by MPTP (20 mg/kg) injection for 7 days. ICT (20 mg/kg) was administered for 14 days, and motor function was assessed using various behavioral tests. Serum estradiol, FSH, LH levels were measured by ELISA, and the expression of PI3K/Akt signaling and apoptosis proteins was analyzed by Western blot. Bone mineral density was assessed via dual-energy X-ray absorption, and histology of the uterus and femur was performed. Results showed that ICT alleviated MPTP-induced motor deficits, increased serum estradiol, and improved uterine atrophy. At the molecular level, ICT activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, reduced apoptosis, and mitigated PD symptoms and osteoporosis induced by OVX. These findings suggest ICT may offer therapeutic potential in managing OVX-induced motor dysfunction and PD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216996642

This condition contributes substantially to the morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes, primarily through myocardial dysfunction independent of coronary artery disease. Current treatment strategies focus on managing symptoms rather than targeting the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, highlighting a critical need for specific therapeutic interventions. This review explores the multifaceted role of empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, in addressing the complex etiology of DCM. We discuss the key mechanisms by which hyperglycemia contributes to cardiac dysfunction, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, and inflammation, and how empagliflozin mitigates these effects. Empagliflozin’s effects on reducing hospitalization for heart failure and potentially lowering cardiovascular mortality mark it as a promising candidate for DCM management. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms through which empagliflozin operates, this review underscores its therapeutic potential and paves the way for future research into its broader applications in diabetic cardiac care. This synthesis aims to foster a deeper understanding of DCM and encourage the integration of empagliflozin into treatment paradigms, offering hope for improved outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating condition. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216825888

More recently, cellular senescence has been shown to have a dual role in prevention and tumor promotion. Senescent cells carry a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which is altered by secretory factors including pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other proteases, leading to the alteration of the tissue microenvironment. Though senescence would eventually halt the growth of cancerous potential cells, SASP contributes to the tumor environment by promoting inflammation, matrix remodeling, and tumor cell invasion. The paradox of tumor prevention/promotion is particularly relevant to the bone niche tumor microenvironment, where longer-lasting, chronic inflammation promotes tumor formation. Insights into a mechanistic understanding of cellular senescence and SASP provide the basis for targeted therapies, such as senolytics, which aim to eliminate senescent cells, or SASP inhibitors, which would eliminate the tumor-promoting effects of senescence.

The study aimed to optimize the culture medium for testicular tissue by using plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) as a serum supplement, addressing the limitations of KSR. Methods: Immature testicular tissues from NMRI mice were cultured for 14 days to identify the optimal PRGF concentration using histological analysis and tubular integrity scoring. Subsequently, tissues were cultured for 42 days with the optimal PRGF concentration and compared to a control group with 10% KSR, followed by evaluation through histological, tubular integrity, and immunofluorescence assays. Results: After 14 days, 5% PRGF media significantly preserved tubule integrity better than 10% and 20% PRGF, performing similarly to 10% KSR. However, after 42 days, the integrity scoring revealed significantly a higher percentage of well-preserved tubules in 5% PRGF compared to 10% KSR. Additionally, only PRGF supported spermatogenesis to the production of flagellated sperm. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that transcript levels of Plzf, Tekt1, and Tnp1 were significantly elevated in 5% PRGF compared to 10% KSR. Immunofluorescence and quantitative analysis confirmed enhanced spermatogenesis progression in 5% PRGF media, with significantly increased numbers of PLZF + spermatogonia, SYCP3 + spermatocytes, ACRBP + spermatids, and Ki67 + proliferating cells per tubule compared to 10% KSR. Moreover, 5% PRGF showed a significantly lower mean fluorescence intensity of the pro-apoptotic marker Bax, with no significant difference in the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2 compared to KSR. Conclusions: The findings suggest that 5%PRGF is a viable alternative to KSR in mouse testicular tissue cultures, promoting structural integrity and spermatogenesis up to the production of flagellated sperm. The results highlight PRGF’s potential to improve culture media for in vitro sperm production, suggesting promising avenues for future human research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216718176

This study investigated whether the mechanism of risperidone (RIS)-induced bone loss is related to ferroptosis. Methods: The schizophrenia mice were induced by administering MK-801. Subsequently, RIS were injected, or ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) co-injected for 8 weeks. Bone loss of schizophrenia mice were assessed using microCT, H&E staining, ALP staining, ARS staining and WB, respectively.

Nonetheless, little is known about the efficacy of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (haMSCs) for KOA in large animal models. Methods: This study evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of haMSCs in knee articular cartilage repair in a sheep model of KOA. haMSCs were isolated, cultured, and characterized. KOA was surgically induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection and medial meniscectomy, followed by intra-articular injection of saline (negative control group) or haMSCs (haMSC group) into the right knee joint at 6 and 9 weeks after surgery. Sheep were sacrificed 21 weeks after surgery, and samples (whole knee joints, femoral condyles, and tibias) were collected, processed, and analyzed. Changes in knee articular cartilage were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, micro-computed tomography, macroscopic analysis, histology, and immunohistochemistry. Results: KOA caused the degeneration of the medial femoral condyle in the sheep model of KOA. Conversely, haMSCs repaired chondral defects and increased the thickness of knee articular cartilage. Conclusions: These data suggest that the intra-articular injection of haMSCs can effectively repair articular cartilage defects in the knee. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216718105

The aim of this study was to estimate sex from metric analysis of the mandible in cone beam computed tomography images (CBCT) of adult Chilean individuals. Methods: Six mandibular measurements were analysed, five linear and one angular, in CBCT of adult Chilean individuals of both sexes. ROC Curve analysis was performed, with cut-off points, and of the overall model quality. Univariate discriminant function analysis was used to determine the accuracy of each measurement for sex estimation. Multivariate discriminant function analysis, both directly and by steps, was used to obtain the predictive value of the mandible including all the measurements. Results: The data included were 155 CBCT, 105 of females and 50 of males. The mandible presented great sexual dimorphism, with the mandibular ramus presenting greater predictive power than the mandibular body. When each mandibular measurement was analysed separately, the maximum height of the mandibular ramus presented the greatest predictive power (76.5%), while the mandibular angle was the least accurate parameter for sex estimation (58.1%). Direct method analysis presented 87.1% accuracy for sex identification of adult Chilean individuals, and joint analysis of maximum mandibular ramus height (MRH), corono-condylar distance and bigonial breadth presented 86.5% accuracy. In ROC Curve analysis the MRH was the variable with the greatest discriminating capacity (AUC = 0.833), MA was the only variable which presented no discriminating capacity (AUC = 0.386) and also presented low quality in model quality analysis. Conclusion: Metric analysis of the mandible in CBCT images presents an acceptable accuracy for sex estimation in Chilean individuals, and its use for that purpose in forensic practice is recommended. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216718039

While it is well-established that numerous cytosolic and nuclear proteins undergo O-GlcNAcylation, the possibility of FTO being O-GlcNAcylated and its functional implications remain unclear. This study found that a negative correlation between FTO expression and O-GlcNAcylation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The decreased O-GlcNAcylation on FTO can result in diminished m6A modification of SRY-related high mobility group box 4 (SOX4). This led to the promotion of cell apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation in MDS/AML. The O-GlcNAcylation of FTO stabilized SOX4 transcripts in an m6A-dependent manner, resulting in increased AKT and MAPK phosphorylation and decreased cell apoptosis. Inhibiting FTO O-GlcNAcylation significantly slowed AML progression in vitro, a finding supported by clinical data in MDS/AML patients. In conclusion, our study highlights the crucial role of FTO O-GlcNAcylation in RNA m6A methylation and the progression of MDS/AML, thereby providing a potential therapeutic avenue for these formidable diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216717980

Numerous studies have investigated the therapeutic potential of endogenous stem cells with particular emphasis on alveolar type 2 epithelial (AEC2) cells owing to their involvement in lung cell renewal. Sox9, a transcription factor known for its role in maintaining stem cell properties and guiding cell differentiation, marks a subset of AEC2 cells believed to contribute to epithelial repair. However, the role of Sox9+AEC2 cells in the distal lung alveolar cells and the potential roles in chemically induced acute lung injury have never been explored. Methods: In this study, we generated Sox9flox/flox;SftpcCre−ERT2 mice and examined the effects of Sox9+AEC2 cells on the pathophysiology of epithelial damage during chemical-induced acute lung injury. Subsequently, Sox9-CreERT2 Ai9 mice were used for lineage tracing to elucidate the repair mechanisms. Results: Our findings revealed that Sox9+AEC2 cells endowed with stem cell properties induced cell proliferation during lung injury, predominantly in the damaged alveolar region. This process is accompanied by the regulation of inflammatory responses and orderly differentiation, thereby promoting epithelial regeneration. Conclusion: These results provide compelling in vivo genetic evidence supporting the characterization of Sox9+AEC2 cells as bona fide lung epithelial stem cells, demonstrating their multipotency and self-renewal capabilities during lung repair and regeneration. The identification of Sox9+AEC2 cells as crucial contributors to the promotion of epithelial repair underscores their potential as therapeutic targets in chemical-induced acute lung injury. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216717920

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown as a promising and attractive alternative treatment for bacterial infections, due to their antibacterial properties and potential to bypass traditional resistance mechanisms. This study aims to shed light on the antibacterial potential of adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (AD-MSC) secretome against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus spp., including MRSA strains. Methods: Using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method, broth microdilution assays, and colony-forming unit (CFU) counting, the antibacterial activity of AD-MSC secretome was assessed. These tests were first conducted on Staphylococcus (S.) aureus ATCC 25923, then on 73 clinical isolates including MRSA strains. Further molecular analysis was performed to identify resistant genes in MRSA isolates. Results: The AD-MSC secretome demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against S. aureus ATCC with a 32 mm inhibition zone. 96% of the collected staphylococcal clinical isolates showed susceptibility to the secretome with 87.5% inhibition observed in MRSA isolates, along with 100% in MSSA, MSSE, and MRSE strains. Molecular analysis revealed that MRSA strains resistant to the secretome harbored mecA, ermA, and ermB genes. Additionally, the mecA-negative MRSA strains remained susceptible to the secretome, suggesting alternative resistance mechanisms. Conclusion: These findings emphasize the ability of AD-MSCs secretome as a promising alternative for treating antibiotic-resistant infections, with potential applications in combating MRSA. However, further research is required to explore its clinical applications as a complementary or standalone therapy for resistant infections. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216717847

Numerous studies have focused on the epigenetic regulation of disuse bone loss; yet limited research has been conducted on the impact of RNA modification bone formation in response to mechanical unloading conditions. In this study, we discovered that m6A reader IGF2BP1 was downregulated in both osteoblasts treated with 2D clinostat and bone tissue in HLU mice. Supplementing IGF2BP1 could promote osteoblast proliferation and partially alleviate the adverse effects of mechanical unloading on bone formation. Mechanistically, IGF2BP1 inhibited the degradation of Lef1 mRNA by directly binding to its mRNA and recognizing the m6A modification. Furthermore, LEF1 promoted osteoblast proliferation by upregulating c-Myc and Cyclin D1 expression, as well as participated in mediating IGF2BP1-induced osteoblast activity under mechanical unloading. Notably, Melatonin (MT) might participate in the regulation of the IGF2BP1/LEF1 axis, thereby regulating the proliferation of osteoblasts and bone formation. Collectively, this study revealed a new insight into the regulation of the MT/IGF2BP1/LEF1 pathway in the process of unloading-induced bone loss, which could potentially contribute to establishing therapeutic strategies for disuse osteoporosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216717844

Recent studies suggest that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from the serum of elderly individuals may play a pivotal role in promoting BMMSC senescence. Glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB), a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, is upregulated during cellular senescence and can regulate stem cell ageing. However, the precise mechanisms by which GPNMB influences BMMSCs senescence remain poorly understood. Understanding this relationship could provide valuable insights into therapeutic strategies for enhancing BMMSCs function and mitigating age-related degeneration. Methods: In this study, we conducted comprehensive in vitro experiments to elucidate the effects of sEVs isolated from the serum of elderly donors on the senescence of BMMSCs. We employed advanced proteomic analysis to quantify the expression levels of GPNMB in both BMMSCs and sEVs. Statistical methods were utilized to investigate the correlations between GPNMB expression, glycosylation modifications, and established senescence markers. Results: Our findings demonstrate a robust positive correlation between the expression of GPNMB in BMMSCs and sEVs and the induction of cellular senescence. Notably, we observed that elevated levels of GPNMB, particularly those bearing bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) modifications, significantly enhance the senescent phenotype of BMMSCs. Furthermore, we identified the bisecting GlcNAc modification at the Asn 249 residue of GPNMB as a critical determinant for its senescence-promoting function. Conclusions: This study elucidates the substantial role of sEVs derived from mesenchymal stem cells in exacerbating BMMSC senescence through mechanisms that are critically dependent on the presence of bisecting GlcNAcylated GPNMB. These insights emphasize the necessity of targeting glycosylation modifications of GPNMB in the design of novel senolytic therapies aimed at mitigating cellular ageing and its associated pathologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216717838

Various factors in the tumor environment (TME) can lead to the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), thereby affecting the occurrence and development of tumors. The objective of our study was to develop and validate a radiogenomic signature based on ERS to predict prognosis and systemic combination therapy response. Methods: Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) as a training cohort and data from International cancer genome consortium (ICGC) as a testing cohort. Univariate Cox regression and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to identify prognostic-related genes and construct a model. HCC single-cell data obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used to map gene signatures and explore inter-cellular signaling communications. Finally, a radiogenomic signature was used to predict the objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Results: A total of four gene signatures related to ERS, including Stanniocalcin-2 (STC2), Melanoma-Associated Antigen 3 (MAGEA3), BR Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase 2 (BRSK2), DEAD/H-Box Helicase 11 (DDX11) were identified. Macrophages were significantly different between high-risk and low-risk groups. The high-risk group showed higher targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and mutated tumor protein p53 (TP53) scores. Drug sensitivity analysis found that most sensitive drugs target the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/ mechanistic target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR) signaling pathway. Further research revealed the expression of STC2 in the endothelial cells (ECs), particularly plasmalemma vesicle associated protein (PLVAP) + ECs, and may regulate the reprogramming and function of macrophages. Furthermore, we identified nine radiomic features and established a radiogenomic signature based on ERS that can predict prognosis and response to systemic combination therapy. This signature can guide systemic combination therapy for patients with unresectable HCC. Conclusions: We established an ERS prognostic model that can predict patient prognosis. We also found that ERS is closely related to the TME and is mainly manifested in the interaction between tumor-associated endothelial cells (TAEs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Moreover, we constructed a radiogenomic signature based on the ERS. This signature can guide subsequent combination therapy for patients with unresectable HCC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216717829

Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) have emerged as a promising source for cellular therapy due to their ability to differentiate into multiple cell types and their paracrine effects. However, the direct injection of BMMSCs can lead to potential unpredictable impairments, prompting a renewed interest in their paracrine effects for AD treatment. The specific mechanism and central role of cytokines in this process have not been fully elucidated. Methods: Mouse BMMSCs were isolated, validated, and then transplanted intracerebrally into APP/PS1 female mice. The behavioral tests, including open-field test, novel object recognition test, and Morris water maze were performed, followed by β-amyloidosis plaque and neuron apoptosis analyses. Then the tissue RNA sequencing and mBMMSC cytokine analysis were performed. A cytokine antibody array for BMMSCs and the brain slice models were performed with AD model tissues were used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms. Finally, APP/PS1 mice were administrated with cytokine mixture for cognitive recovery. Results: Our results demonstrated that BMMSCs significantly improved cognitive function, reduced beta-amyloid plaque deposition, and decreased apoptotic neurons through the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Using a cytokine antibody array, we identified three highly expressed AKT pathway regulated neuroprotective factors in BMMSCs: IGF1, VEGF, and Periostin2. These cytokines were found to upregulate inhibitors of apoptosis family proteins (IAPs) and suppress Caspase-3 activity in brain slices induced with beta amyloidosis (Aβ), okadaic acid (OA), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). When injection of this cytokine mixture to APP/PS1 mice also resulted in a mitigation of cognitive impairment. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the secretory factors IGF1, VEGF, and Periostin2 derived from BMMSCs play a crucial role in neuroprotection by modulating the AKT/IAPs pathway to restore neuronal function. These cytokine sets could be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD and lay the groundwork for promising clinical applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216717767

Osteoporotic complications, including vertebral compression fractures, hip fractures, and distal forearm fractures, affect over 8.9 million individuals globally, placing a significant economic strain on healthcare systems. Recent advances have expanded our understanding of the mechanisms underlying osteoporosis, particularly the intricate regulatory networks involved in bone metabolism. A central player in these processes is ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, a crucial post-translational modification system that involves ubiquitin, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), ubiquitin ligase (E3), deubiquitinating enzymes, and the proteasome. Among the various E3 ligases, the NEDD4 family has emerged as a key regulator of both bone development and osteoporotic pathology. This review delineates the role of NEDD4 family in osteoporosis and identifies potential drug targets within these pathways, offering insights into novel therapeutic approaches for osteoporosis through targeted intervention. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216717699

The persistent need for innovative therapeutic approaches to mend damaged heart tissue highlights the complexity and urgency of this medical challenge. In recent years, stem cells have emerged as a promising tool for tissue regeneration, but challenges such as graft rejection and tumor formation have limited their clinical application. Exosomes, extracellular vesicles containing a diverse array of biomolecules, have garnered significant attention for their potential in regenerative medicine. The cardioprotective and reparative properties of mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes hold promise for the treatment of heart diseases. These exosomes can modulate various cellular processes, including angiogenesis, apoptosis, and inflammation, thereby enhancing cardiac function. Despite the growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews synthesizing the molecular mechanisms, preclinical, and clinical evidence related to the specific role of MSC-derived exosomes in cardiac therapies. This review aims to fill that gap by exploring the potential of MSC-derived exosomes as a therapeutic strategy for cardiac diseases. This review explores the potential of mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes as a therapeutic strategy for cardiac diseases. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying their cardioprotective effects, summarize preclinical and clinical studies investigating their efficacy, and address the challenges and future perspectives of exosome-based therapies. The collective evidence suggests that MSC-derived exosomes hold promise as a novel and effective therapeutic approach for cardiac diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216717628

This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating the efficacy and safety of these modalities, providing insights into their comparative advantages for clinical practice. In a prospective, evaluator-blinded study, 40 participants with Fitzpatrick Skin Types (FST) III and IV underwent three treatment sessions at four-week intervals with either PSAL or QLNYL. Efficacy was primarily assessed by changes in Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) scores at baseline, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks, along with patient satisfaction evaluations at the 12- and 24-week marks, and safety assessments conducted throughout the study. Both groups experienced significant reductions in MASI scores post-treatment. Overall, the improvement in MASI scores in the QLNYL group significantly surpassed that in the PSAL group (P = 0.010). Patient satisfaction was comparably high between groups, and no significant differences were noted in safety profiles. The PSAL group showed a slightly higher incidence of adverse reactions (not significant) and significantly higher pain scores (P = 0.018). Recurrence rates at the 24-week follow-up were 10.5% for PSAL and 0% for QLNYL, with no significant difference. Both PSAL and QLNYL proved effective in treating melasma, with the traditional combined modality of QLNYL demonstrating superior efficacy in FST III-IV.

In this study, we have developed a strategy based on multichrome encoding and “AND” Boolean logic recognition for multiplexed, spatially resolved imaging of single-cell RNA epigenetic modifications, termed as PRoximity Exchange-assisted Encoding of Multichrome (PREEM). Through the implementation of this strategy, we can now map the expression and nuclear distribution of multiple site-specific RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications at the single-molecule resolution level in single-cells, and reveal the previously unknown heterogeneity. Notably, we demonstrate how these patterns change after treatment with various drugs. Moreover, cyclic imaging with tailed DNA self-assembly further suggest the scalability and adaptability of PREEM’s design. As an innovative epigenetic modification imaging tool, PREEM not only broadens the horizons of single-cell epigenetics research, enabling joint analysis of multiple targets beyond the limitations of imaging channels, but also reveals cell-to-cell variability, thereby enhancing our capacity to explore cellular functions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216608045

CHB induced inflammation and injury trigger multiple biochemical and physical changes that include the promotion of a wide range of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors that activate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) CHB induced activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is regarded as a central event in fibrogenesis to directly promote the synthesis of myofibroblasts and the expression of a range of materials to repair injured liver tissue. Fibrogenesis is modulated by the mainstream epigenetic machinery, as well as by non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that are often referred to as an ancillary epigenetic response to fine tune gene expression. Although extensive research has explained the regulatory role of ncRNA in liver fibrogenesis, most of this research relates to non-CHB etiologies. This review paper outlines the complex interactive regulatory role of microRNA (miRNA) and their interaction with long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), circular RNA (circRNA) and the mainstream epigenetic machinery in CHB induced liver fibrosis. The paper also illustrates some of the difficulties involved in translating candidate ncRNA into approved drugs or diagnostic tools. In conclusion, the important regulatory role of ncRNA in CHB induced liver fibrosis warrants further investigation to exploit their undoubted potential as diagnostic and therapeutic agents. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216607982

Microglia have been identified as having a high capacity for iron deposition, yet it remains unclear whether microglia undergo ferroptosis while phagocytosing excessive amounts of iron after spinal cord injury (SCI). Here, we observed scattered iron around the epicenter of the injured spinal cord at 7 days post-injury (dpi) in mice, which then accumulated in the lesion core at 14 dpi. Concurrently, microglia exhibited elevated expression of the iron-storage protein ferritin and were found to undergo ferroptosis between 7 and 28 dpi. Additionally, we noted a gradual decrease in glycosylated lysosomal membrane protein (GLMP) which is associated with iron metabolism in microglia undergoing ferroptosis. In situ injection of AAV9-Cx3cr1-shGlmp-eGFP to knock down GLMP specifically in microglia resulted in a significant increase in iron deposition and ferroptosis, leading to an expanded lesion area, aggravated neuronal loss, and subsequent inhibition of functional restoration. Our findings highlight the crucial role of GLMP in mitigating iron overload and ferroptosis in microglia, thereby contributing to axon retention and locomotor recovery after SCI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216607974

To understand the complex chemical and hydrodynamic processes within the mine pool, it is critical to establish effective practices and management strategies. This study focuses on the characterisation of hydrodynamic processes affecting flooded underground mines, emphasising the importance of density stratification. The investigation of 29 ore and coal mine shafts and their corresponding physico-chemical depth profile measurements was aimed to compare the profiles with each other, while also taking into account the shaft geometry and the layout of the mine. Finding cross-links between the profiles, which allow universal statements on stratification in flooded underground mines, was the main objective. Results of this study indicate that stratification occurs in almost all flooded underground mines, and the uppermost stratified water body is usually located in the area of the first or second connected level. Furthermore, stratification is often responsible for considerably better quality of the uppermost water body. Hence, stratification is fundamental to mine water management and has a direct influence on the quality of the discharged water. This knowledge is invaluable in developing strategies to optimise mine closure, mine water management, treatment planning and future mine layouts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216607953

Post-injury cardiomyocyte (CM) loss can lead to myocardial dysfunction and failure. Although neonatal mammalian hearts can regenerate, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, comparative transcriptome analyses identify adherens junction protein N-Cadherin as a crucial regulator of CM proliferation/renewal. Its expression correlates positively with mitotic genes and shows an age-dependent reduction. N-Cadherin is upregulated in the neonatal mouse heart following injury, coinciding with increased CM mitotic activities. N-Cadherin knockdown reduces, whereas overexpression increases, the proliferation activity of neonatal mouse CMs and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs. Mechanistically, N-Cadherin binds and stabilizes pro-mitotic transcription regulator β-Catenin, driving CM self-renewal. Targeted N-Cadherin deletion in CMs impedes cardiac regeneration in neonatal mice, leading to excessive scarring.

Methods: We used population-based linked administrative health databases from British Columbia, Canada to evaluate pharmacotherapy and psychological treatments for incident depression and/or anxiety among individuals with IA and without IA (‘IA-free controls’). We defined minimally adequate pharmacotherapy as antidepressant prescriptions filled with ≥ 84 days’ supply and adequate psychological treatment as ≥ 4 counselling/psychotherapy services. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the odds of individuals with IA receiving minimally adequate pharmacotherapy and/or psychological treatment compared to IA-free controls. Results: 6,951 (mean age 54.8 ± 18.3 years; 65.5% female) individuals with IA had incident depression and 3,701 (mean age 52.9 ± 16.8 years; 74.3% female) had incident anxiety. Minimally adequate pharmacotherapy and psychological treatment for depression was respectively observed in 50.5% and 19.6% of those with IA, proportions similar to IA-free controls (pharmacotherapy: aOR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.21; psychological: aOR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.21). Results were similar regarding anxiety treatment. Individuals with IA had a significantly greater likelihood of dispensing ≥ 1 benzodiazepine (anxiety: IA 45.0%, IA-free controls 39.0%, p-value < 0.001) and ≥ 1 tricyclic antidepressant prescription (anxiety: IA 12.8%, IA-free controls 7.8%, p-value < 0.001). Significantly higher average days’ supply of benzodiazepines was observed for IA (anxiety: IA 123.7 days, controls 112.4 days, p-value = 0.003). Conclusions: A substantial proportion of individuals with IA were not receiving adequate mental health treatment for depression and anxiety, a finding similar for IA-free controls. The undertreatment of mental disorders for people with IA has well-known negative implications for the provision of effective rheumatology care. It remains fundamental to expand publicly funded health care to include mental health services in an effort to address unmet counselling needs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216578156

This study aims to understand women’s preferences and willingness for undergoing risk assessment tests. Methods: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted. Six attributes were selected to construct the DCE questionnaire: one-time cost of the test, methods for reducing late-stage breast cancer, annual breast cancer screening expenses, insurance coverage for early-stage breast cancer, family risk correlation, and risk communication methods. Women aged between 21 and 59 were recruited from Singapore. Latent class analysis was performed. Results: Three hundred twenty-eight women were included in the analysis and classified into two classes: test supporters and non-supporters. Both classes prioritised test costs and screening costs. Among non-cost attributes, the potential to reduce late-stage breast cancer diagnosis was the most influential factor. Insurance coverage increased willingness to undergo testing. Risk communication methods were not significant in influencing the decision of undergoing tests. Non-supporters were less inclined to take the test if family risk correlation was high. Younger women, married women, full-time employees, and those with a history of breast disease were more likely to be supporters. Women with a family history of breast cancer were more likely to be non-supporters. Conclusions: Financial incentives play a notable role in increasing the uptake of risk-prediction tests. However, the programme’s success depends on understanding and addressing the diverse preferences of women. While cost considerations ranked highly, additional strategies are needed to engage groups that are hesitant, particularly those with a high family risk correlation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216575920

At the forefront of the tumor microenvironment (TME) orchestrating the initiation and advancement of HCC are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). TGF-β, widely recognized as a potent activator of CAFs, not only regulates their activity but also assumes a pivotal role in the metastatic journey of the tumor. In our recent study, drawing from the GEO database, we identified two fibroblast subtypes in HCC through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and explore the expression and distribution of TGF-β and its receptors in the TME of HCC. Subsequently, we investigated the interactions between tumor cells expressing high levels (TGFB1high) and low levels (TGFB1low) of TGF-β in the HCC TME and the two subtypes of CAFs. We also employed multi-color immunohistochemistry (mIHC) technology to examine the expressions of FAP, α-SMA, CD4, Foxp3, and TGF-β in HCC tissues within a tissue microarray. Additionally, we analyzed clinical associations, prognostic values, and the correlation of these molecules. These insights advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving HCC progression and underscore the intricate interplay between tumor cells and the stromal components of the TME. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216569325

Although the CBF/DREB1 family has been identified in many plants, studies of the CBF/DREB1 family in alfalfa are insufficient. Results: In this study, 25 MsCBF genes were identified in the genome of alfalfa (“Zhongmu No. 4”). These genes were distributed on chromosomes 1, 5, 6 and unassembled scaffolds. Phylogenetics divided the CBF members of Medicago sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Medicago truncatula into six groups, of which group VI had the most MsCBFs members, reaching 52% (13/25). Gene duplication analysis showed that 64% (16/25) of MsCBFs formed tandem duplications, and 32% (8/25) formed segment duplications. The expression pattern of MsCBF9 under different hormone treatments was verified by RT-qPCR, and it was found that MsCBF9 responded to GA3, IAA, SA, and MeJA. Overexpression of MsCBF9 in Arabidopsis significantly delayed the flowering time of Arabidopsis. In contrast, the flowering time of the cbfs mutant was earlier, and overexpression of MsCBF9 also increased the number and size of Arabidopsis rosette leaves. Conclusion: In this study, the CBF/DREB1 family of alfalfa was comprehensively identified and analyzed, and the function of MsCBF9 in regulating flowering time was studied. This study laid a foundation for further analysis of the function of the CBF family in alfalfa.

It is an inherited autosomal recessive disease. The onset of symptoms can vary depending on disease type and severity, with milder forms presenting in adulthood. The main clinical manifestations include cytopenia, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and bone lesions. GD is characterized by several bone manifestations, such as osteopenia/osteoporosis, focal lytic or sclerotic lesions, osteonecrosis acute or chronic bone pain, Erlenmeyer flask deformity, and subchondral joint collapse with secondary degenerative arthritis. In 70–100% of patients affected by Gaucher disease type 1, clinical or radiographic evidence of bone disease occurs. Among bone complications, osteoporosis is very common, but its etiopathogenesis in GD is not completely clear. Results deriving from experimental studies support the hypothesis that there is an aberrant activity of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts due to several factors, resulting in impaired bone turnover. Bone complications represent the main cause of pain, disability, and reduced quality of life in these patients. Therefore, there is a need to enhance awareness among physicians on the skeletal manifestations throughout life of GD patients, in order to improve diagnosis and management of bone complications. In particular, this narrative review focuses on risk of bone fragility in GD, etiopathogenetic hypotheses, epidemiological data, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of osteoporosis in patients suffering from Gaucher disease, specifying the challenges not yet addressed. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216507710

These hormonal fluctuations are associated with increased iron levels, which ultimately lead to iron accumulation. This study aims to investigate the effects of Deferasirox on iron homeostasis and hematopoiesis in ovariectomized rats with iron accumulation. Sixty-four female Wistar rats were divided into eight groups and underwent ovariectomy surgery to simulate menopause. Iron accumulation was induced through the injection of ammonium ferric citrate. Deferasirox was administered at doses of 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg. Hematological parameters, iron profile, antioxidant markers, oxidative stress indicators, histopathological evaluation of uterine, bone, bone marrow, liver, and spleen tissues, flow cytometric analysis of hematopoietic CD markers, and relative expression of Hamp, Pu.1, Gata1, and Gdf11 genes were analyzed. Deferasirox treatment improved histopathological changes in the uterine tissue of ovariectomized rats with iron accumulation, increased the number of white blood cells, and reduced serum iron levels, TIBC, ferritin, and transferrin saturation percentage. It also increased serum antioxidant capacity and reduced oxidative stress markers. Deferasirox had a positive effect on femur bone, hematopoietic cell count, volume of hematopoietic and adipose tissues in bone marrow, extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver and spleen, and influenced the relative expression of Hamp, Pu.1, Gata1, and Gdf11 genes related to hematopoiesis and iron metabolism. In conclusion, Deferasirox effectively manages iron homeostasis and hematopoiesis in ovariectomized rats with iron accumulation and suppresses oxidative stress. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216440149

Our previous study revealed that reduced levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) of women with PCOS resulted in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, it is still uncertain whether increasing NAD+ levels in the ovaries could improve ovarian function in PCOS. In this study, we demonstrated that supplementation with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) prevented the decrease in ovarian NAD+ levels, normalized estrous cycle irregularities, and enhanced ovulation potential in dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS mice. Moreover, NR supplementation alleviated ovarian fibrosis and enhanced mitochondrial function in ovarian stromal cells of PCOS mice. Furthermore, NR supplementation improved oocyte quality in PCOS mice, as evidenced by reduced abnormal mitochondrial clustering, enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased ROS levels, reduced spindle abnormality rates, and increased early embryonic development potential in fertilized oocytes. These findings suggest that supplementing with NAD+ precursors could be a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing ovarian infertility associated with PCOS. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216439793

Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of IBS. Previous studies have demonstrated that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) has analgesic effects. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether PPARγ activation ameliorates oxidative stress and affects thus nociceptive sensitization and emotional responses in IBS. Methods: The study utilized male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, that suffered from neonatal colorectal distension (CRD), to assess the effects of various doses of rosiglitazone on visceral hyperalgesia and anxiety. Electromyography (EMG) of the external abdominal oblique muscles was used to evaluate visceral hypersensitivity, and Open Field Test (OFT) and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) were used to evaluate anxiety. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the spinal cord were analyzed by water-soluble tetrazolium-1 (WST-1) and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) methods, respectively, the expression levels of PPARγ in the spinal cord were assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Results: Neonatal CRD-induced rats showed visceral pain sensitization and anxiety in adulthood, with down-regulated expression of PPARγ and SOD and elevated MDA levels in the spinal cord. Rosiglitazone alleviated visceral hypersensitivity and anxiety by activating PPARγ protein expression and promoting MDA up-regulation and SOD down-regulation in the spinal cord, which were reversed by GW9662, an antagonist of PPARγ. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that rosiglitazone alleviated visceral pain sensitization and anxiety in male IBS rats by alleviating oxidative stress through activation of PPARγ. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216439709

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can interact with biological components, triggering processes like protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, or DNA damage, resulting in the generation of several volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Recently, VOCs provided new insight into cellular metabolism and can serve as potential biomarkers. The objective is to investigate the impact of OS on cell metabolism by analyzing the release or alterations of VOCs in the headspace of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. An OS model in differentiated 3T3-L1 cell lines was constructed using hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) treatment. The effect of OS on cell metabolism was analyzed by detecting VOCs in the headspace of the cells using solid phase micro extraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). Our findings indicate that H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> concentrations exceeding 300 µM induce significant OS, leading to adipocyte apoptosis, as evidenced by various assays. Of the twenty VOCs identified, ten were upregulated in the cells. VOCs such as diphenyl ether, 1,3,5-trioxane, 5-methyl tridecane, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, and 2,4-di-tert-butyl phenol emerged as potential biomarkers for OS. This study demonstrates that elevated OS alters VOC profiles in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, providing insights into the effects of OS on adipose tissue and identifying potential OS biomarkers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216439706

Corticosteroids are commonly used to prevent NRDS in clinical. However, the protective mechanism of the corticosteroids remains largely unclear. Methods: In this study, the simulation of the molecular docking by Autodock, in vitro binding experiments, and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway examination in cells were performed to study the directly binding of cortisol to Smoothened (SMO). To explore the effect of cortisol action on the SHH pathway on neonatal lung development, we generated a genetic mouse, in which leucine 116 (L112 in human) of SMO was mutated to alanine 116 (L116A, Smoa/a) by the CRISPR-Cas9, based on sequence differences between human and mice. Then, we performed morphological analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on lung tissue and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: In this study, we reported that cortisol, the endogenous glucocorticoid, inhibited the sonic hedgehog (Shh)/SMO-mediated proliferation of lung fibroblasts to maintain the normal lung development. Specifically, cortisol competed with cholesterol for binding to the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) in SMO to inhibit the activation of Shh/SMO signaling, a critical signaling known for cell proliferation. Cortisol did not inhibit the activation of SMO when L112 in its CRD was mutated to A112. Moreover, Smoa/a (L116A) mice exhibited the immature lungs in which over-proliferation of interstitial fibroblasts and reduction in the surfactant protein were evident. Conclusion: Together, these results suggested that cortisol regulated cholesterol stimulation of SMO by competitively binding to the CRD to regulate neonatal lung maturation in mice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216439685

A randomized single-blind method was applied to divide 120 age- and weight-matched New Zealand white rabbits into six groups: control groups (30 d, 60 d, 90 d) and overload/microgravity groups (30 d, 60 d, 90 d), with 20 rabbits per group. The expression of MMP1, MMP3, and TIMP1 in the lumbar intervertebral discs was measured and analyzed using statistical methods, including chi-square tests and t-tests, across different exposure times. Results: In the experimental groups, MMP1 and MMP3 expression levels were significantly higher than those in the corresponding control groups at all time points (P < 0.01). MMP1 and MMP3 levels progressively increased with longer exposure durations, showing statistically significant differences (P < 0.01). TIMP1 expression was significantly higher in the 30-day and 60-day experimental groups than in the control group (P < 0.01), but decreased in the 90-day group, indicating a late-stage imbalance in the MMP/TIMP1 ratio. Conclusion: Simulated overload and microgravity conditions lead to elevated MMP1, MMP3, and TIMP1 expression in lumbar intervertebral discs, promoting accelerated disc degeneration. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216439642

In particular, HER2 + BC has been defined as a ""lipogenic disease"" due to the functional and bi-directional crosstalk occurring between HER2-mediated oncogenic signaling and FA biosynthesis via FA synthase activity. In this context, the functional role exerted by the reprogramming of CD36-mediated FA uptake in HER2 + BC poor prognosis and therapy resistance remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate whether enhanced CD36 in mesenchymal HER2 + cancer stem cells (CSCs) is directly involved in anti-HER2 treatment refractoriness in HER2 + BC and to design future metabolism-based approaches targeting both FA reprogramming and the “root” of cancer. Methods: Molecular, biological and functional characterization of CD36-mediated FA uptake was investigated in HER2 + BC patients, cell lines, epithelial and mesenchymal CSCs. Cell proliferation was analyzed by SRB assay upon treatment with lapatinib, CD36 inhibitor, or Wnt antagonist/agonist. Engineered cell models were generated via lentivirus infection and transient silencing. CSC-like properties and tumorigenesis of HER2 + BC cells with or without CD36 depletion were examined by mammosphere forming efficiency assay, flow cytometry, cell sorting, ALDH activity assay and xenograft mouse model. FA uptake was examined by flow cytometry with FA BODIPY FL C16. Intratumor expression of CSC subsets was evaluated via multiplex immunostaining and immunolocalization analysis. Results: Molecular data demonstrated that CD36 is significantly upmodulated on treatment in therapy resistant HER2 + BC patients and its expression levels in BC cells is correlated with FA uptake. We provided evidence of a consistent enrichment of CD36 in HER2 + epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like CSCs from all tested resistant cell models that mechanistically occurs via Wnt signaling pathway activation. Consistently, both in vitro and in vivo dual blockade of CD36 and HER2 increased the anti-CSC efficacy of anti-HER2 drugs favoring the transition of the therapy resistant mesenchymal CSCs into therapy-sensitive mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET)-like epithelial state. In addition, expression of CD36 in intratumor HER2 + mesenchymal CSCs is significantly associated with resistance to trastuzumab in HER2 + BC patients. Conclusions: These results support the metabolo-oncogenic nature of CD36-mediated FA uptake in HER2 + therapy-refractory BC. Our study provides evidence that targeting CD36 might be an effective metabolic therapeutic strategy in the treatment of this malignancy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216439598

These cells possess capabilities for self-renewal, proliferation, and multi-lineage differentiation. Compared to model animals like rats and mice, pigs exhibit greater physiological similarity to humans. Porcine skin has very similar histological and physiological characteristics to human skin. Therefore, porcine skin is becoming increasingly significant as an in vitro model for research. In this study, porcine skin-derived stem cells (pSDSCs) were isolated and cultured in vitro for experiments. The expression of stemness-related gene SOX9 was detected. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) results found that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway was significantly enriched in SOX9+ pSDSCs. To investigate the role of the mTOR signaling pathway, we added rapamycin (RAPA), an inhibitor of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), and found that the proliferation rate of SOX9+ pSDSCs decreased significantly during culture. In addition, western blotting (WB) results demonstrated that mTORC1 promoted proliferation by phosphorylating S6 kinase (S6K) and then activating cyclin D1(CCND1) in SOX9+ pSDSCs. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of adult stem cell proliferation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216439502

The phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) is regarded as the first step in vascular pathology and contributes to arterial remodeling. Exosomes facilitate the transfer and exchange of proteins and specific nucleic acids, thereby playing a significant role in intercellular communication. Little is known about the modulatory role of serum exosomes in phenotypic switching of VSMC and vascular remodeling in TAK. Methods: Serum exosomes isolated from TAK patients were co-cultured with VSMC to identify the modulatory role of exosomes. VSMC were transfected with miR-199a-5p mimic and inhibitor. CCK8 assays and EdU assays were performed to measure proliferative ability. The migration of VSMC was evaluated by scratch assays and transwell migration assays. The flow cytometry was employed to identify apoptosis of VSMC. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation assay and fluorescence in situ hybridization were utilized to validate the target gene of miR-199a-5p. The correlational analysis was conducted among exosome miRNA, serum MMP2, TIMP2 and clinical parameters in TAK patients. Results: The coculture of VSMC with serum exosome mediated dedifferentiation of VSMC. Through gain- and loss-of-function approaches, miR-199a-5p over-expression significantly increased expression of VSMC marker genes and inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration, whilst the opposite effect was observed when endogenous miR-199a-5p was knocked down. The overexpression of miR-199a-5p suppressed VSMC apoptosis. Further, MMP2 serves as functional target gene of miR-199a-5p. The correlation analyses revealed an inverse correlation between Vasculitis Damage Index and exosome miR-199a-5p level or serum MMP2, which requires validation in a larger cohort. Conclusion: Our study indicated that the miR-199a-5p/MMP2 pathway played a role in inhibiting the migration, proliferation and apoptosis of VSMC. The decreased secretion of MMP2 may potentially prompt the intimal infiltration of inflammatory cells within the vascular wall, offering a novel therapeutic opportunity by tackling both inflammatory responses and the neointimal overgrowth associated with TAK arterial damage. Moreover, exosome miR-199a-5p and MMP2 derived from serum possess potential as future biomarkers for vascular injury. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216439437

Here, inspired by the reaction mechanisms of intracellular antioxidant defense systems, we propose the de novo design of an artificial antioxidase using Ru-doped layered double hydroxide (Ru-hydroxide) for efficient redox homeostasis and maxillofacial bone regeneration. Our studies demonstrate that Ru-hydroxide consists hydroxyls-synergistic monoatomic Ru centers, which efficiently react with oxygen species and collaborate with hydroxyls for rapid proton and electron transfer, thus exhibiting efficient, broad-spectrum, and robust ROS scavenging performance. Moreover, Ru-hydroxide can effectively sustain stem cell viability and osteogenic differentiation in elevated ROS environments, modulating the inflammatory microenvironment during bone tissue regeneration in male mice. We believe this Ru-hydroxide development offers a promising avenue for designing antioxidase-like materials to treat various inflammation-associated disorders, including arthritis, diabetic wounds, enteritis, and bone fractures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216439195

This study identifies key woundhealing genes involved in UCEC and elucidates their roles through a comprehensive analysis. Methods: In silico and in vitro experiments. Results: Seventy wound healing-associated genes were extracted from the Gene Ontology (GO) database, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database. CytoHubba analysis in Cytoscape identified six pivotal hub genes: CD44, FGF2, FGF10, KDM6A, FN1, and MMP2. These genes exhibited significantly lower expression in UCEC cell lines compared to normal controls, as confirmed by RT-qPCR. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated their potential as diagnostic biomarkers, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.94 to 1.00. Validation using TCGA datasets revealed consistent downregulation of these genes in UCEC samples, corroborated by immunohistochemical staining. Promoter methylation analysis showed significantly higher methylation levels in UCEC, correlating with decreased mRNA expression and poor survival outcomes. Genetic alteration analysis indicated frequent mutations in FN1 and KDM6A, although these did not significantly affect survival. Functional analysis using the CancerSEA database highlighted the involvement of these genes in critical cancer-related processes, including angiogenesis, apoptosis, and metastasis. Immune correlation studies revealed significant associations with immune inhibitor genes and distinct expression patterns across immune subtypes. Overexpression studies in UCEC cell lines demonstrated that CD44 and MMP2 reduce proliferative ability while enhancing migration and wound healing. Conclusion: Collectively, these findings underscore the crucial roles of CD44, FGF2, FGF10, KDM6A, FN1, and MMP2 in UCEC pathogenesis, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in this malignancy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216439129

Blood vessels in bone regulate osteogenesis and hematopoiesis, however, whether LVs in bone affect fracture healing is unclear. Here, we investigate the lymphatic draining function at the tibial fracture sites using near-infrared indocyanine green lymphatic imaging (NIR-ICG) and discover that lymphatic drainage insufficiency (LDI) starts on day one and persists for up to two weeks following the fracture in male mice. Sufficient lymphatic drainage facilitates fracture healing in male mice. Furthermore, we identify that lymphatic platelet thrombosis (LPT) blocks the draining lymphoid sinus and LVs, causes LDI, and inhibits fracture healing in male mice, which can be rescued by a blood thinner. Moreover, unblocked lymphatic drainage decreases neutrophils and increases M2-type macrophages of the hematoma niche to support osteoblast (OB) survival and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) proliferation via transporting damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in male rats. Lymphatic platelet thrombolysis also benefits senile fracture healing in female mice. These findings demonstrate that LPT limits bone regeneration by impeding lymphatic transporting DAMPs.

This study aims to develop a novel composite material combining enzymatic nanoparticles and nerve growth factor (NGF) to modulate the immune microenvironment and enhance SCI repair. Methods: CeMn nanoparticles (NP) and CeMn NP-polyethylene glycol (PEG) nanozymes were synthesized via sol–gel reaction and DSPE-mPEG modification. Transmission Electron Microscopy, Selected-Area Electron Diffraction, X-ray Diffraction and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy confirmed their crystalline structure, mixed-valence states, and redox properties. Size uniformity, biocompatibility, and catalytic activity were assessed via hydrodynamic diameter, zeta potential, and elemental analysis. The Lightgel/NGF/CeMn NP-PEG composite was synthesized and characterized via electron microscopy, compression testing, rheological analysis, NGF release kinetics, and 30-day degradation studies. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the composite on SCI. Results: The Lightgel/NGF/CeMn NP-PEG composite was successfully synthesized, exhibiting favorable physical properties. At a CeMn NP-PEG concentration of 4 µg/mL, the composite maintained cell viability and demonstrated enhanced biological activity. It also showed superior mechanical properties and an effective NGF release profile. Notably, the composite significantly upregulated the expression of nerve growth-associated proteins, reduced inflammatory cytokines, scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS), and promoted M2 macrophage polarization by inhibiting the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway. In a rat SCI model, it facilitated functional recovery and attenuated inflammation.

However, the molecular mechanism of apolipoproteins underlying NTDs development remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the function of apolipoprotein M (ApoM) in the pathogenesis of NTDs and its underlying mechanisms. We demonstrated that ApoM expression was reduced in the spinal cord samples of rat models and human fetuses with NTDs respectively. Specifically, lack of ApoM resulted in reduced cytosolic localization of Elavl2 and caused Nnt mRNA degradation, which further led to impaired cell homeostasis by suppressing PINK1-PRKN-mediated mitophagy and promoting apoptosis and subsequent NTDs formation. Moreover, Zic3 directly interacted with the promoter of ApoM and activated its transcription. Lastly, intra-amniotic delivery of adenoviral recombinant Zic3 or ApoM could promote mitophagy and alleviate apoptosis in spinal cords of NTDs. Collectively, these findings highlight the important role of the Zic3-ApoM-Elavl2-Nnt axis in cellular homeostasis during neural tube development, thereby revealing an intracellular molecular regulatory mechanism of ApoM, providing a mechanistic basis for understanding embryonic neural development, and offering experimental evidence for potential therapeutic targets for NTDs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216439101

This investigation aims to examine the causal association between viral infections of the central nervous system (VICNS) and inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (IDCNS) and knee osteoarthritis (KOA) at the genetic level. Methods: In this investigation, VICNS and IDCNS were considered as primary exposure variables, while KOA served as the primary outcome. Employing a two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we conducted an analysis utilizing summary data derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The GWAS summary data pertaining to VICNS and IDCNS were procured from the Finnish consortium, whereas the IEU OpenGWAS database furnished the requisite data for KOA. To ensure the robustness of our genetic causal assessment, a comprehensive array of sensitivity analyses was undertaken, encompassing evaluations of heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, outlier identification, leave-one-out analyses, and assessment of the normal distribution. Results: The results of the MR analyses revealed a suggestive positive genetic causal relationship between VICNS and KOA (P = 0.012, odds ratio [OR] with a 95% confidence interval [CI] of 1.033 [1.007–1.059]). Conversely, the MR analyses did not indicate any evidence of genetic causation between IDCNS and KOA (P = 0.575, OR 95% CI = 0.986 [0.940–1.035]). Importantly, the genetic causal assessment of the exposure and outcome variables did not demonstrate any indications of heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, or outliers. Furthermore, this assessment remained robust against the influence of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and exhibited adherence to a normal distribution. Conclusion: The result of this study has elucidated a suggestive positive genetic causal link between the VICNS and KOA. However, no such genetic causal relationship was observed between the IDCNS and KOA. These findings substantiate the genetic underpinnings supporting the association between the CNS and OA. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216439093

Using biological augmentation in the form of the highly vascular subacromial bursa, was used to improve tendon healing. This work aimed to evaluate the results of arthroscopic guided mini-open transosseous repair with bursal augmentation in the treatment of MRCTs in a five-step approach. Forty-eight patients, with a mean age of 63.15 years, were treated with this technique. The patients were evaluated with the constant, UCLA and VAS scores. Plain X-rays were performed to evaluate the CSA and MRI was done to confirm the diagnosis of MRCT and determine the degree of fatty degeneration. Ultrasound was done at 1 year post-operative to determine any retears. The mean follow-up period was 29 months ± 4.95. The Constant and UCLA mean scores improved from (52.52) to (89) and (13.2) to (30.5) respectively (p < 0.0001). The post-operative active flexion and abduction improved from a mean of (112° to 170°) and (136.2° to 167°) respectively, while ER improved from (62.8° to 70°) with their p values (p < 0.0001). Pain improved from a mean VAS of (5.85) to (0.5) (p < 0.0001). No deterioration of function was noted throughout the follow-up period, and no retears occurred on post-operative ultrasound evaluation.

By acting as molecular bridges between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) through integrins and other surface receptors, they regulate key cellular signals that influence cell behavior and tissue architecture. Despite their physiological importance, our understanding of the role of LMs in cancer pathobiology remains fragmented. In this article, we review the diverse functions of LMs in promoting cancer cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration—critical steps in cancer metastasis. Beyond their direct effects on tumor cells, LMs influence stromal interactions and modulate tumor microenvironment dynamics, affecting processes such as angiogenesis, immune cell infiltration, cancer-associated fibroblast activation, and immune evasion. Understanding the complex roles of LMs in cancer biology, as well as their differential expression patterns in malignancies, could provide new diagnostic tools for predicting disease outcomes and pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies, such as targeting LM-receptor interactions or modulating ECM dynamics to impede tumor growth and metastasis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216261737

However, how the antenna-like pseudopodia affect gene transfection is unsettled and the underlying trafficking mechanism of exogenous genes in engineered single cells is not announced. Therefore, the engineered microarray biochips were conceptualized and prepared by the synthesized photointelligent biopolymer to precisely manage geometric topological structures (cell size and antenna-like protrusion) of stem cells on biochips. The cytoskeleton could be regulated in engineered cells and large cells with more antennas assembled well-organized actin filaments to affect cell tension distribution.

This study aimed to evaluate adherence rates of multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA) testing, following updated guidelines recommending screening starting at age 45. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used aggregated data from Exact Sciences Laboratories LLC, examining new users (first-time testers) aged 45–85 with commercial, Medicare, or Medicaid insurance who received mt-sDNA test kits (point-of-care) between January 1, 2023, and June 1, 2023. Adherence was defined as the percentage of eligible participants returning a valid non-empty test kit within 365 days of initial shipment date. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to analyze adherence. Results: Among 1,557,915 patients, the overall adherence rate to mt-sDNA testing was 71.3% (commercial insurance 72.3%, Medicare Advantage 70.2%, Medicare 69.9%, Medicaid 52.0%) (p < 0.001). Females had slightly higher adherence than males, except for commercial insurance (72.2% vs. 72.6%, p < 0.001). Adherence was highest in commercial insurance for individuals aged 76–85 (79.2%, p < 0.001), gastroenterology patients (82.5%, p < 0.001), and rural residents (73.2%, p < 0.001), along with those in Medicare Advantage earning $200 K + (78.5%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Adherence to mt-sDNA testing was robust, particularly among individuals with commercial insurance, older adults, gastroenterology patients, higher income groups, and rural residents. With a 71% adherence rate, the test demonstrates substantial engagement and value in colorectal cancer screening.

Addressing this question represents a need for ensuring global health and wellbeing to all individuals in a world facing the progressive increase of aging and aging related diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) exposure on development and skeletal phenotype using the osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) zebrafish model Chihuahua (Chi/+), carrying a dominant glycine substitution in the α1 chain of collagen I and their wild-type (WT) littermates. To this purpose Chi/+ and WT zebrafish expressing the green fluorescent protein under the early osteoblast marker osterix were exposed from 1 to 6 days post fertilization to 0.36, 1.5 and 3.0 mg/L PFOS, 0.005 and 0.5 mg/L PFOA and 0.01, 0.48 and 16.0 mg/L PFHxA, and their development and skeletal phenotype investigated. Morphometric measurements, confocal microscopy evaluation of operculum area delimited by the fluorescent preosteoblasts and mineral deposition analysis following alizarin red staining were employed. PFOS and the highest concentration of PFHxA significantly impaired standard length in both genotypes. Osteoblast differentiation was significantly compromised by PFOS and by PFOA only in Chi/+. Limited to WT exposed to PFOA a reduced mineralization was also observed. No effect was detected after PFHxA exposure. Apoptosis was only activated by PFOA, specifically in Chi/+ mutant operculum osteoblasts. Interestingly, an altered lipid distribution in both WT and mutant fish was revealed after exposure to both pollutants. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that PFAS impair operculum development mainly compromising cell differentiation in mutant fish whereas alter lipid hepatic distribution in both genotypes with a more severe effect on Chi/+ preosteoblast survival. These results represent a first warning sign of the negative impact of PFAS exposure in presence of genetically determined skeletal fragility. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216237926

This study aimed to explore the neuroprotective effects of the probiotic formulation VSL#3® and its underlying mechanism in a PD mouse model induced by MPTP. Following MPTP administration, the striatal levels of dopamine and its metabolites, as along with the survival rate of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, were significantly reduced in PD mice. MPTP also significantly increased the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β, while reducing anti-inflammation mediators, like glia cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the striatum. These pathological changes were notably mitigated by VSL#3® treatment, suggesting its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in the brain. Additionally, VSL#3® significantly lowered the circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduced TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA expression in the liver, indicating an inhibition of cytokine transfer. In the intestine, the probiotic treatment markedly decreased the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-17), and the other two key components of the NLRP3 inflammasome, caspase-1 and NLRP3, demonstrating an inhibition of VSL#3® on gut NLRP3 inflammasome. VSL#3® exerts neuroprotective effects in PD mice through the suppression of intestinal inflammation, particularly inhibiting the intestinal NLRP3 inflammasome. This study supports the therapeutic potential of targeting intestinal inflammation and utilizing probiotics in PD treatment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216210920

However, molecular mechanisms underlying the association between mitophagy and OA remain unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of the autophagy receptor protein optineurin (OPTN) in OA, and explore the effects of dietary intervention on OA symptoms and its relationship with OPTN-mediated mitophagy. Our findings showed the downregulation of OPTN in patients with OA. Using an Optn-knockout mouse model, we demonstrated that OPTN deficiency leads to impaired mitophagy, resulting in the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, increased production of reactive oxygen species, and chondrocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, fasting prevented OA progression by activating OPTN-mediated mitophagy and maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in mice. The present study revealed a novel mechanism by which OPTN-mediated mitophagy influences chondrocytes and the OA phenotype in Optn-knockout mice, suggesting that OPTN-mediated mitophagy plays a crucial role in OA development and progression.

Single-cell RNA sequencing data of ischemic brain tissue revealed that most of the high-affinity IL-2R would be expressed by CD8 + T cells, especially by a highly-proliferative subset. Interestingly, only the CD8 + T cells with high-affinity IL-2R infiltrated ischemic brain tissues, highly expressing 32 genes (including Cdc20, Cdca3/5, and Asns) and activating 7 signaling pathways (including the interferon-alpha response pathway, a key mediator in the proliferation, migration, and cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells). Its interaction with endothelial cells and the ligand-receptor interaction analysis also suggested an augmented brain infiltration after cerebral ischemia. In IL-2Rα KO mice, who would have no high- or low-affinity IL-2R in CD8 + T cells, the RNA-seq, qPCR, immunofluorescence, and multiplex assays found that the expression of CD8b, CD122, CD132, and Vcam-1 was upregulated in the acute phase of cerebral ischemia, with decreasing H2-k1 positive cells and increasing Vcam-1 and CD8b positive cells in brain tissue. However, inflammation pathways in brain were inhibited and peripheral inflammatory cytokine levels were reduced, indicating that CD8 + T cells changed into an anti-inflammatory phenotype. The IL-2Rα KO mice after cerebral ischemia also performed better in behavioral tests and had more favorable results in diffusion tensor imaging, electrophysiology, and MBP testing.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two blocks of southern Rajasthan to determine the prevalence of Sickle Cell Trait (SCT) and SCD. The study population underwent screening for SCD initially using the solubility test method. Family members of individuals tested positive for the solubility test were also screened. Subsequently, blood samples were collected from individuals who were positive for the solubility test. The confirmation of SCT and SCD was carried out through HPLC. Results: The prevalence of SCT and SCD was 9.87% and 0.32%, respectively. The highest combined prevalence (including SCT and SCD) of 15.52% was observed among the Garasiya tribe, followed by the Bhil tribe with the prevalence of 9.68%. Conclusion: SCD is moderately prevalent, with less than a per cent among the tribal population of Southern Rajasthan. However, the prevalence of SCT is about 10%.

These vesicles serve as mediators of intercellular communication, facilitating the transfer of bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleotide. In autoimmune diseases, exosomes have been implicated in modulating immune responses, oxidative stress, autophagy, gut microbes, and the cell cycle, contributing to disease initiation, progression, and immune dysregulation. Recent advancements in exosome isolation techniques and their molecular characterization have paved the way for exploring their clinical potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review focuses on the mechanisms by which exosomes influence autoimmune disease development and their potential clinical applications, particularly in diagnosis. The role of exosomes in autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), is discussed in relation to their involvements in antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and the induction of inflammatory pathways. Additionally, exosome-based biomarkers offer promising non-invasive diagnostic tools for early diagnostic, disease monitoring, and therapeutic response assessment. However, challenges such as standardization of exosome isolation protocols and validation of their clinical significance remain. This review highlights the potential of exosomes as both diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in autoimmune diseases, emphasizing the need for further research to overcome current limitations and fully harness their clinical value. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216053754

This paper seeks to clarify the specific mechanisms by which neutrophils play a bidirectional role in tumor immunity and the factors that influence these roles. By conducting a comprehensive analysis and synthesis of a vast array of relevant literature, it has become evident that neutrophils can influence tumor development and invasive migration through various mechanisms, thereby exerting their anti-tumor effects. Conversely, they can also facilitate tumorigenesis and proliferation, as well as affect the normal physiological functions of other immune cells, thus exerting pro-tumor effects. Moreover, neutrophils are influenced by tumor cells and their unique microenvironment, which in turn affects their heterogeneity and plasticity. Neutrophils interact with tumor cells to regulate various aspects of their life activities precisely. This paper also identifies unresolved issues in the research concerning the bidirectional role of neutrophils in tumorigenesis and tumor development, offering new opportunities and challenges for advancing our understanding.

Methods: We assessed the expression of pyroptosis-related biomarkers and IL-8 in tissues and human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) from both control and nasal polyp patients using western blot. Their localization was determined through immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Cell death and cytotoxicity assay, electron microscopy, ELISA, and immunofluorescence were utilized to investigate IL-8-induced pyroptosis and GC resistance in hNECs, alongside the examination of the involved signaling pathways via western blot and immunofluorescence. In a murine model, hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry clarified relationship between pyroptosis and GC resistance. Results: IL-8 and pyroptotic biomarker expression were significantly higher in nasal polyp-derived tissues and hNECs compared to controls. IL-8 showed a positive correlation and co-localized with the pyroptotic biomarkers. IL-8 triggered pyroptosis in hNECs by activating the ERK signaling pathway, leading to increased IL-1β and IL-18 secretion. Moreover, IL-8-induced pyroptosis was found to contribute to GC resistance by affecting phosphorylation of GC receptor Ser211. Inhibition of pyroptotic proteins mitigated IL-8-induced GC resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: Elevated IL-8 facilitates pyroptosis via the ERK signaling pathway and plays a significant role in GC resistance in nasal polyps. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216047014

Irisin, a ubiquitous cytokine, exhibits antioxidant properties. However, the role of irisin in AP remains inconclusive. Our study aims to elucidate irisin expression in AP patients and investigate its mechanism of action to propose a novel treatment strategy for AP. Serum irisin levels in 65 AP patients were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and correlated with disease severity scores. Core genes implicated in AP-related oxidative stress were identified and screened via bioinformatics analysis. The therapeutic efficacy of irisin in AP was confirmed using a murine cerulein-induced AP model. The intrinsic mechanism of irisin’s antioxidative stress action was investigated and verified in pancreatic AR42J cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). Common targets shared by irisin and AP were further validated using a molecular docking model which was constructed for virtual docking analysis. This study investigated alterations in redox status in AP and found a significant reduction in serum irisin levels, correlating inversely with AP severity. In a murine AP model, we showed that irisin triggers an antioxidative stress program via the KEAP1 gene; this process helps reestablish redox balance by decreasing the buildup of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and suppressing the secretion of inflammatory mediators within pancreatic tissues Notably, increased KEAP1 expression counteracted the antioxidative effects of irisin. Our findings unveil a novel therapeutic mechanism for AP, wherein irisin inhibits KEAP1 to alleviate OS. Increasing irisin levels in vivo presents a promising strategy for AP treatment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85216044952

However, the molecular pathogenesis of pLEC remains poorly understood. Methods: In this study, we explored pLEC using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies. Datasets of normal lung tissue, other types of NSCLC, and EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma (EBV+-NPC) were obtained from public databases. Furthermore, we described the gene signatures, viral integration, cell quantification, cell death and immune infiltration of pLEC. Results: Compared with other types of NSCLC and EBV+-NPC, pLEC patients exhibited a lower somatic mutation burden and extensive copy number deletions, including 1p36.23, 3p21.1, 7q11.23, and 11q23.3. Integration of EBV associated dysregulation of gene expression, with CNV-altered regions coinciding with EBV integration sites. Specifically, ZBTB16 and ERRFI1 were downregulated by CNV loss, and the FOXD family genes were overexpressed with CNV gain. Decreased expression of the FOXD family might be associated with a favorable prognosis in pLEC patients, and these patients exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity. Conclusion: Compared with other types of NSCLC and NPC, pLEC has distinct molecular characteristics. EBV integration, the aberrant expression of genes, as well as the loss of CNVs, may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of pLEC. However, further research is needed to assess the potential role of the FOXD gene family as a biomarker. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215995310

DBF4 plays a critical role in DNA replication and participates in various biological functions, making it an attractive target for cancer treatment. However, its significance in ccRCC has not yet been explored. Methods: We utilized external datasets and bioinformatics analyses to investigate the significance of DBF4 in ccRCC. We analysed its expression patterns, prognostic and diagnostic value, and potential mechanisms. We subsequently validated our findings through an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay of ccRCC clinical samples. We further investigated the impact of DBF4 on the progression of ccRCC cells. Various assays, including assessments of cell proliferation, apoptosis, the cell cycle, cell migration and invasion, and colony formation, and xenograft tumor models were subsequently performed following to the knockdown of DBF4 expression via shRNA. Results: Bioinformatics analyses revealed that DBF4 is significantly overexpressed in ccRCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. This overexpression was confirmed by IHC analysis of 75 pairs of clinical ccRCC tumor and adjacent tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high DBF4 expression was associated with a significantly lower five-year overall survival rate. Moreover, DBF4 expression was identified as an independent risk factor in multivariate Cox regression analysis. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed a substantial enrichment of terms associated with cell division, whereas gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed correlations between increased DBF4 expression and the activation of cell cycle-related pathways. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that DBF4 knockdown in ccRCC cells not only suppressed proliferation and migration in vitro but also significantly inhibited tumor growth in xenograft mice by arresting the cell cycle at the G1/G0 phase, which was mediated by the inhibition of MCM2 phosphorylation and cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression. Conclusion: The current study revealed that DBF4 overexpression is a significant factor associated with malignant features and poor prognosis in patients with ccRCC. Therefore, it was proposed that DBF4 could serve as a novel potential prognostic biomarker and molecular target for ccRCC.

First, this review provides a brief introduction to the current state-of-the-art for neuro-ectoderm brain organoid development, emphasizing their biggest advantages in comparison with classical two-dimensional cell cultures and animal models. However, despite their usefulness for developmental studies, a major limitation for most brain organoid models is the absence of contributing cell types from endodermal and mesodermal origin. As such, current research is highly investing towards the incorporation of a functional vasculature and the microglial immune component. In this review, we will specifically focus on the development of immune-competent brain organoids. By summarizing the different approaches applied to incorporate microglia, it is highlighted that immune-competent brain organoids are not only important for studying neuronal network formation, but also offer a clear future as a new tool to study inflammatory responses in vitro in 3D in a brain-like environment. Therefore, our main focus here is to provide a comprehensive overview of assays to measure microglial phenotype and function within brain organoids, with an outlook on how these findings could better understand neuronal network development or restoration, as well as the influence of physical stress on microglia-containing brain organoids. Finally, we would like to stress that even though the development of immune-competent brain organoids has largely evolved over the past decade, their full potential as a pre-clinical tool to study novel therapeutic approaches to halt or reduce inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration still needs to be explored and validated. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215979457

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the key components of the prominent PDAC stroma. Data on clinical relevance of CAFs entering the bloodstream, known as circulating CAFs (cCAFs) are scarce. Here, we developed a combined liquid biopsy assay to detect cCAFs and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in metastatic PDAC (mPDAC) and other metastatic gastrointestinal malignancies (mGI). In addition, we evaluated plasma hyaluronan (HA) levels as a complementary surrogate biomarker of the stromal extent in patients with PDAC. Methods: A sequential liquid biopsy assay based on a two step-enrichment, combining marker dependent and independent cell enrichment, was established for cCAF and CTC detection and validated in mPDAC and mGI patients. The enriched cells were identified by multiplex immunofluorescence. HA measurement was performed by ELISA on blood samples from healthy blood donors (HD), localized and late-stage PDAC patients. Results: cCAFs (≥ 1cCAFs/7.5 mL blood) were detected in 95.4% of mPDAC and in 78.2% of mGI patients, with significantly higher numbers in mPDAC compared to mGI patients (mean number 22.7 vs. 11.0; P = 0.0318). mPDAC patients with ≥ 15 cCAFs/7.5 mL blood had a significant shorter median overall survival (mOS 3.2 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.801–5.855) vs. 14.2 months (95% CI 6.055–22.332); P = 0.013), whereby CTC levels were not associated with mOS. In mGI neither cCAFs nor CTCs had a significant impact on OS. HA plasma levels in mPDAC patients were significantly higher compared to HD (mean 123.0 ng/mL vs. 74.45 ng/mL, P = 0.015). High HA in localized and late-stage PDAC were associated with a significantly shorter mOS (mOS<inf>localized PDAC</inf>: 12.6 months vs. 23.5 months (P = 0.008); mOS<inf>mPDAC</inf>: 1.8 months vs. 5.3 months (P = 0.004)). Conclusions: Our liquid biopsy assay provides robust detection of cCAFs in mPDAC and mGI patients.

Forkhead Box Protein G1 (FOXG1) is associated with osteogenesis, however, the effect of FOXG1 on osteogenesis of BMSCs and ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss is unknown. In our study, FOXG1 expression in BMSCs increases after osteogenic induction. FOXG1 overexpression significantly increases osteoblast marker expression ALP activity, and calcium deposition, while the opposite results are observed in FOXG1 knockdown BMSCs, suggesting that FOXG1 promotes osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, autophagy promotes the differentiation process in BMSCs. We find that FOXG1 induces autophagy, and osteogenic differentiation is blocked via inhibiting FOXG1-caused autophagy, indicating that FOXG1 accelerates osteogenic differentiation via inducing autophagy. Eight-week-old female C57BL/6J mice are used in OVX models, FOXG1 overexpression decreases bone loss by increasing bone formation. Moreover, FOXG1 overexpression suppresses osteoclast differentiation. Mechanically, FOXG1 transcriptionally represses ubiquitin-specific protease14 (USP14) via binding to the USP14 promoter. USP14 overexpression prevents the promoting effect of FOXG1 on osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs. Therefore, our findings suggest that FOXG1 promotes BMSC osteogenic differentiation and inhibits osteoclast differentiation, eventually blocking OVX-induced bone loss, which may provide a promising approach for osteoporosis treatment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215962100

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway plays an essential role in OA. To address the lack of studies focused on synovial cells in OA, we evaluated the expression patterns and roles of the MAPK signaling pathway components in OA synovial tissues using bioinformatics. The JUN, MYC, and VEGFA expression levels were significantly higher in the synovial tissues of patients with OA than in control tissues. These loci were closely related to abnormal proliferation, inflammation, and angiogenesis in the synovial tissues of patients with OA. We speculate that Myc and VEGFA activate the p38-MAPK signaling pathway to further activate Jun, thereby promoting abnormal inflammation, proliferation, and angiogenesis in OA synovial tissue. The high MYC, JUN, and VEGFA expression was positively correlated with the patients’ K-L score, pain time, and synovial score. Furthermore, the high p38-MAPK and P-p38-MAPK expression confirmed that the abnormal expression and activation of the MAPK signaling pathway occurred in the synovial tissue of patients with OA.

It contains a phosphocholine (PC) headgroup and polyunsaturated fatty acids that, when oxidized, form reactive oxidized phospholipids (PC-OxPLs). PC-OxPLs are pathogenic in multiple diseases and neutralized by anti-PC IgM antibodies. The levels of anti-PC IgM increase as the levels of PC-OxPLs increase and, in humans, are inversely correlated with the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and steatohepatitis. PC-OxPLs also decrease bone mass in mice. Overexpression of anti-PC IgM ameliorates atherosclerosis and steatohepatitis, increases bone mass in young mice, and protects against high fat diet- and age-associated osteoporosis. We investigated the relationship between anti-PC IgM plasma levels and bone mineral density (BMD) in a cross-sectional study of 247 participants [mean age: 65.5 (± 8.6) years] without medical conditions known to influence BMD or antibody production. Anti-PC IgM levels negatively correlated with both T- and Z-scores at the lumbar spine, femur and, to a lesser extent, the forearm. These correlations were maintained after adjustment for age, race, and sex. These results raise the possibility that higher levels of anti-PC IgM in patients with lower BMD reflect exposure to higher levels of PC-OxPLs, which are known to affect bone mass, and could be a novel risk marker for osteoporosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215952656

While newly approved amyloid immunotherapy has been reported, effective AD drugs remain to be identified. Here, we propose a novel AI-driven drug-repurposing method, DeepDrug, to identify a lead combination of approved drugs to treat AD patients. DeepDrug advances drug-repurposing methodology in four aspects. Firstly, it incorporates expert knowledge to extend candidate targets to include long genes, immunological and aging pathways, and somatic mutation markers that are associated with AD. Secondly, it incorporates a signed directed heterogeneous biomedical graph encompassing a rich set of nodes and edges, and node/edge weighting to capture crucial pathways associated with AD. Thirdly, it encodes the weighted biomedical graph through a Graph Neural Network into a new embedding space to capture the granular relationships across different nodes. Fourthly, it systematically selects the high-order drug combinations via diminishing return-based thresholds. A five-drug lead combination, consisting of Tofacitinib, Niraparib, Baricitinib, Empagliflozin, and Doxercalciferol, has been selected from the top drug candidates based on DeepDrug scores to achieve the maximum synergistic effect. These five drugs target neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and glucose metabolism, which are all related to AD pathology. DeepDrug offers a novel AI-and-big-data, expert-guided mechanism for new drug combination discovery and drug-repurposing across AD and other neuro-degenerative diseases, with immediate clinical applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215945994

Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a severe blistering disease caused by COL7A1 pathogenic variants. Although underscored by animal studies, the endotypes of human RDEB are poorly understood. To fill this gap, we apply systems immunology approaches using single-cell high-dimensional techniques to capture the signature of peripheral immune cells and the diversity of metabolic profiles in RDEB adults, sampled outside of any opportunistic infection and active cancer. Our study, demonstrates the particular inflammation and immunity characteristics of RDEB adults, with activated / effector T and dysfunctional natural killer cell signatures, concomitant with an overall pro-inflammatory lipid signature. Artificial intelligence prediction models and principal component analysis stress that RDEB is not solely confined to cutaneous issues but has complex systemic endotypes marked by immune dysregulation and hyperinflammation. By characterising the phenotype-endotype association in RDEB adults, our study lays the groundwork for translational interventions that could by lessening inflammation, alleviate the everlasting suffering of RDEB patients, while awaiting curative genetic therapies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215760210

A debilitating cancer-related phenotype is skeletal muscle loss, or cachexia, which occurs partly from tumor products secreted into circulation. Using the LinkedOmicsKB knowledge base assembled from the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium proteogenomic analysis, along with catalogs of human secretome proteins, ligand-receptor pairs and molecular signatures, we sought to identify candidate pan-cancer proteins secreted to blood that could regulate skeletal muscle phenotypes in multiple solid cancers. Tumor proteins having significant pan-cancer associations with muscle were referenced against secretome proteins secreted to blood from the Human Protein Atlas, then verified as increased in paired tumor vs. normal tissues in pan-cancer manner. This workflow revealed seven secreted proteins from cancers afflicting kidneys, head and neck, lungs and pancreas that classified as protein-binding activity modulator, extracellular matrix protein or intercellular signaling molecule. Concordance of these biomarkers with validated molecular signatures of cachexia and senescence supported relevance to muscle and cachexia disease biology, and high tumor expression of the biomarker set associated with lower overall survival. In this article, we discuss avenues by which skeletal muscle and cachexia may be regulated by these candidate pan-cancer proteins secreted to blood, and conceptualize a strategy that considers them collectively as a biomarker signature with potential for refinement by data analytics and radiogenomics for predictive testing of future risk in a non-invasive, blood-based panel amenable to broad uptake and early management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215759932

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying the switch in receptor binding preferences of EA H1N1 SIV remain elusive. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen utilizing EA H1N1 SIV in porcine kidney cells. Knocking out the enzyme gamma glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) reduces virus replication in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the carboxylation modification of viral haemagglutinin (HA) and the adhesion of progeny viruses, ultimately impeding the replication of EA H1N1 SIV. Furthermore, GGCX is revealed to be the determinant of the D225E substitution of EA H1N1 SIV, and GGCX-medicated carboxylation modification of HA 225E contributes to the receptor binding adaption of EA H1N1 SIV to the α-2,6 SA receptor. Taken together, our CRISPR screen has elucidated a novel function of GGCX in the support of EA H1N1 SIV adaption for binding to α-2,6 SA receptor.

Bone tissue engineering (BTE) is gaining attention as an alternative to autologous and allogeneic transplantation due to the limited availability of donors. Biomaterials represent a promising strategy for bone regeneration, and their design should consider the three key processes in bone tissue engineering: osteogenesis, bone conduction, and bone induction. Certain bile acids (BAs) demonstrate significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunosuppressive properties, and effectively promote bone and tissue regeneration. Additionally, the combination of BA molecule with other biological materials can help overcome problems associated with limited local bone regeneration and maintain a defined release state for a long time.

Pinpointing genetic factors linked to body size gain enhances breeding efficiency and economic value. In this study, we used the MGISEQ-T7 platform to re-sequence 240 Zhongwei goats (133 male; 107 female) belonging to 5 metrics of growth traits at different growth stages (40 days and 6 months, here in after referred to as 40d and 6 m), namely, Body Weight (BW), Body Height (BH), Body Length (BL), Chest Circumference (CC), Tube Circumference (TC) were examined. A Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to identify candidate genes associated with the five indicators of body conformation traits, thereby establishing a foundation for subsequent investigations into the biological functions of these genes. Results: A total of 19.89 Tb of raw data was generated with an average sequencing depth of about 20×. After quality control, 15,958,716 SNPs were available for the analysis. A total of 342 genome-wide significant SNPs were obtained. Among them, in the two physiological stages of 40d and 6 m, 147 and 32 SNPs were significantly associated with BW; 1 and 4 SNPs were significantly associated with BH; 19 and 6 SNPs were significantly associated with BL; 33 and 64 SNPs were significantly associated with CC, 34 and 2 SNPs were significantly associated with TC. These SNPs were annotated to 425 candidate genes. Finally, A total of 39 candidate genes are closely related to biological processes such as skeletal muscle development, skeletal formation, carcass quality, and embryonic development, where ADIPOQ, CCDD39, PTPRT, ZNF215, VRTN, ABCD4, DLST, ADAMTS2, ROBO1, AKAP13, AQPI, SOX2, and AHSG were identified as an important component of the genetic framework that may control somatic conformational traits in Zhongwei goats. which warrants further investigation and review.

The NLRP3 inflammasome triggers pyroptosis, a programmed cell death that amplifies inflammation and tissue damage. This study evaluates the efficacy of Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAEs) in reconstructing gene data related to NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in periodontitis. The NCBI GEO dataset GSE262663, containing three samples with and without hypoxia exposure, was analyzed using unsupervised K-means clustering. This method identifies natural groupings within biological data without prior labels. VGAE, a deep learning model, captures complex graph relationships for tasks like link prediction and edge detection. The VGAE model demonstrated exceptional performance with an accuracy of 99.42% and perfect precision. While it identified 5,820 false negatives, indicating a conservative approach, it accurately predicted 4,080 out of 9,900 positive samples. The model’s latent space distribution differed significantly from the original data, suggesting a tightly clustered representation of the gene expression patterns. K-means clustering and VGAE show promise in gene expression analysis and graph structure reconstruction for periodontitis research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215758055

Its progression is influenced by complex interactions involving genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), have been identified as key regulators of gene expression, affecting diverse biological processes, notably programmed cell death (PCD). Objective: This review aims to explore the relationship between ncRNAs and PCD in CRC, focusing on how ncRNAs influence cancer cell survival, proliferation, and treatment resistance. Methods: A comprehensive literature analysis was conducted to examine recent findings on the role of ncRNAs in modulating various PCD mechanisms, including apoptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, and their impact on CRC development and therapeutic response. Results: ncRNAs were found to significantly regulate PCD pathways, impacting tumor growth, metastasis, and treatment sensitivity in CRC. Their influence on these pathways highlights the potential of ncRNAs as biomarkers for early CRC detection and as targets for innovative therapeutic interventions. Conclusion: Understanding the involvement of ncRNAs in PCD regulation offers new insights into CRC biology. The targeted modulation of ncRNA-PCD interactions presents promising avenues for personalized cancer treatment, which may improve patient outcomes by enhancing therapeutic effectiveness and reducing resistance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215757829

Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of PEVs in treating diabetic wounds. To assess the efficacy and safety of PEVs in treating diabetic wounds, we conducted a systematic review of several databases and performed a meta-analysis using a random effects model. Nine studies (n = 128 animals) meeting the inclusion criteria for this review were identified. The pooled analysis revealed that compared to the control group, wounds treated with PEVs had a higher healing rate (SMD = 4.43, 95% CI = 2.85–6.01, P < 0.00001). In subgroup analysis, PEVs combined with hydrogel showed better efficacy than PEVs alone (SMD = 7.96, 95% CI = 5.05–10.87, P < 0.00001). Additionally, the PEVs treatment group outperformed the control group in other outcomes, such as vessel density and number, re-epithelialization rate, and collagen deposition. PEVs have the potential to promote angiogenesis at diabetic wound sites and alleviate inflammatory responses, ultimately aiding in wound healing, especially when combined with hydrogels or other medications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215757571

This project aimed to undertake systematic data linkage to identify and invite eligible Māori women to participate in breast screening. Methods: This is a cross-sectional observational study conducted in Northern New Zealand between 1/01/2020 and 30/06/2021. The BreastScreen Aotearoa (BSA) register was linked with the primary care data to identify and invite eligible Māori women (aged 45–69 years) to breast screening, who were not currently enrolled in BSA, and who were enrolled in BSA but had not been screened or overdue for breast screening. Invitations were sent through invitation letters, text messages and phone calls. Enrolment to BSA and screening participation at 15 and 18 months from the project’s start date were reported. Results: Through the data linkage, 2295 women who were not enrolled in BSA were identified eligible for breast screening. Approximately half (n = 1086) of the women were contactable within 5 contact attempts. Of these contactable, 345 (32%) women were enrolled in BSA, 421 (39%) were screened at 15 months, increasing to 441 (41%) at 18 months from the project start. Among women who were previously enrolled but never screened or overdue for screening, 1470 women were eligible. Their contact details were updated through the data linkage, which facilitated BSA to contact them successfully for breast screening. Consequently, 305 (21%) of these eligible were screened at 15 months, and increased to 332 (23%) at 18 months. Conclusions: The data linkage approach has evidenced the benefit of a population register to facilitate equitable access to breast screening services.

This study aimed to explore the role of baicalein and its relevant mechanism in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). The bioinformatics tools were used to predict the targets of baicalein and AR-related genes. AR mice were induced by ovalbumin (OVA) and treated with lentivirus-encapsulated knockdown of nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) or protein arginine N-methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) plasmids and baicalein. IL-4/IL-13-induced human nasal mucosal epithelial cells (HNEpC) were transfected with knockdown of NR4A1 or PRMT1 plasmids and baicalein treatment. Baicalein alleviated AR-like symptoms and reduced the levels of immunoglobulin E, histamine, and LTC4 in serum and IL-4, IL-25, and IL-33 concentrations in nasal lavage fluids of mice induced with OVA by increasing NR4A1 expression. NR4A1 blocked the NFκB/p65 pathway by mediating transcriptional repression of PRMT1. Knockdown of PRMT1 overturned the effects of NR4A1 knockdown on IL-4/IL-13-induced HNEpC and OVA-induced mice. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that baicalein activation of NR4A1 mediates transcriptional repression of PRMT1 and relieves AR in mice by blocking the NFκB/p65 pathway. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215599473

Various factors are connected to autophagy, and the mechanism regulating autophagy is highly complicated. Epigenetic changes, such as aberrant expression of histone demethylase, are actively associated not only with oncogenesis but also with inflammatory responses. Among post-translational modifications, histone lysine methylation holds significant importance. There are over 30 members of histone lysine demethylases (KDMs), which act as epigenetic regulators in physiological processes and diseases. Importantly, KDMs are abnormally expressed in the regulation of cellular autophagy and inflammation, representing a crucial mechanism affecting inflammation-related diseases. This article reviewed the function of KDMs proteins in autophagy and inflammation. Specifically, It focused on the specific regulatory mechanisms underlying the activation or inhibition of autophagy, as well as their abnormal expression in inflammatory responses. By analyzing each KDM in epigenetic modification, this review provides a reliable theoretical basis for clinical decision marking regarding autophagy abnormalities and inflammatory diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215598004

Although the formation of atherosclerosis, which is closely related to oxidative stress (OS), is associated with stroke-related deaths. However, the role of OS in IS is unknown. Methods: OS-related key genes were obtianed by overlapping the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between IS and normal control (NC) specimens, IS-related genes, and OS-related genes. Then, we investigated the mechanism of action of key genes. Subsequently, protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and machine learning algorithms were utilized to excavate feature genes. In addition, the network between feature genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) was established to investigate the regulatory mechanism of feature genes. Finally, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was utilized to validate the expression of feature genes with blood specimens. Results: A total of 42 key genes related to OS were acquired. Enrichment analysis indicated that the key genes were associated with oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species, lipid and atherosclerosis, and cell migration-related pathways. Then, 6 feature genes (HSPA8, NCF2, FOS, KLF4, THBS1, and HSPA1A) related to OS were identified for IS. Besides, 6 feature genes and 255 miRNAs were utilized to establish a feature genes-miRNA network which contained 261 nodes and 277 edges. At last, qPCR results revealed that there was a trend for higher expression of FOS, KLF4, and HSPA1A in IS specimens than in NC specimens. Additionally, HSPA8 expression was significantly decreased in the IS specimens, which was consistent with the findings of the GEO database analysis. Conclusion: In conclusion, 6 feature genes (HSPA8, NCF2, FOS, KLF4, THBS1, and HSPA1A) related to OS were mined by bioinformatics analysis, which might provide a new insights into the evaluation and treatment of IS.

On top of that, we used a generalized additive model (GAM) to find any non-linear correlations, and a two-piecewise linear regression model to find the threshold effects in the smoothing curves that came out of it. To ensure the aforementioned result was stable, a subgroup analysis was carried out. Results: The results showed a positive linear correlation between FAR and β-CTX [β = 1.077, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24 to 1.92, P = 0.012]. The study’s findings demonstrated that FAR and P1NP fit curves in an inverted U-shaped pattern, and an inflection point K = 0.0685 for FAR was detected. P1NP showed a positive correlation with FAR below the inflection point (β = 306.10, 95% CI: 47.37 to 564.83, P = 0.021), and a negative correlation with FAR beyond the inflection point (β = -117.57, 95% CI: -231.34 to -3.80, P = 0.043). The subgroup analysis revealed that women had a more significant association between FAR and β-CTX in women than in men. Conclusions: The results provide useful insights into the potential association between FAR and markers of bone metabolism. The study may provide a novel clinical implication by introducing FAR as a potential reference indicator for assessing bone health, offering a cost-effective and conveniently obtainable biomarker to monitor inflammation to improve bone metabolism in the treatment of osteoporosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215563755

Persistent low-grade inflammation defines OA pathogenesis, with crucial involvement of pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages. While mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and their small extracellular vesicles (sEV) hold promise for OA treatment, achieving consistent clinical-grade sEV products remains a significant challenge. This study aims to develop fully characterized, reproducible, clinical-grade batches of sEV derived from umbilical cord (UC)-MSC for the treatment of OA while assessing its efficacy and safety. Initially, a standardized, research-grade manufacturing protocol was established to ensure consistent sEV production. UC-MSC-sEV characterization under non-cGMP conditions showed consistent miRNA and protein profiles, suggesting their potential for standardized manufacturing. In vitro studies evaluated the efficacy, safety, and potency of sEV; animal studies confirmed their effectiveness and safety. In vitro, UC-MSC-sEV polarized macrophages to an anti-inflammatory M2b-like phenotype, through STAT1 modulation, indicating their potential to create an anti-inflammatory environment in the affected joints. In silico studies confirmed sEV's immunosuppressive signature through miRNA and proteome analysis. In an OA mouse model, sEV injected intra-articularly (IA) induced hyaline cartilage regeneration, validated by histological and μCT analyses. The unique detection of sEV signals within the knee joint over time highlights its safety profile by confirming the retention of sEV in the joint. The product development of UC-MSC-sEV involved refining, standardizing, and validating processes in compliance with GMP standards. The initial assessment of the safety of the clinical-grade product via IA administration in a first-in-human study showed no adverse effects after a 12 month follow-up period. These results support the progress of this sEV-based therapy in an early-phase clinical trial, the details of which are presented and discussed in this work. This study provides data on using UC-MSC-sEV as local therapy for OA, highlighting their regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties and safety in preclinical and a proof-of-principle clinical application. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215547358

Although significant strides have been made in understanding bone marrow adipose tissue over the past decade, many questions remain regarding their precise lineage and functional roles. Recent Findings: Recent studies have highlighted bone marrow adipose tissue’s involvement in continuous cross-talk with other organs and systems, exerting both endocrine and paracrine functions that play a crucial role in metabolic homeostasis, skeletal remodeling, hematopoiesis, and the progression of bone metastases. The advancement of imaging techniques, particularly cross-sectional imaging, has profoundly expanded our understanding of the complexities beyond the traditional view of bone marrow adipose tissue as an inert depot. Notably, marrow adipocytes are anatomically and functionally distinct from brown, beige, and classic white adipocytes. Emerging evidence suggests that bone marrow adipocytes, bone marrow adipose tissue originate from the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells; however, they appear to be a heterogeneous population with varying metabolic profiles, lipid compositions, secretory properties, and functional responses depending on their specific location within the bone marrow.

The inflammatory response during the progression of CVD has attracted considerable attention. Mitochondria serve as the principal energy source for the heart. In cardiovascular illnesses, mitochondrial homeostasis is disrupted, accompanied by structural and functional impairments. During mitochondrial stress or injury, mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), such as mitochondrial DNA, cardiolipin, N-formyl peptide, and adenosine triphosphate, are released to activate pattern recognition receptors and trigger immunological responses. Inflammatory responses mediated by mtDAMPs substantially contribute to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular illnesses. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms by which different mtDAMPs control the inflammatory response, address the pathological consequences of mtDAMPs in inducing or exacerbating the inflammatory response in CVDs, and summarize potential therapeutic targets in relevant experimental studies. Preventing or reducing mtDAMP release may play a role in CVD progression by alleviating the inflammatory response. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Note,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215545947

Recent Findings: Germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are the first line of defense against danger and infections. In the bone microenvironment, PRRs and downstream signaling pathways, that mount immune defense, interface intimately with the core cellular processes in bone cells to alter bone formation and resorption. The role of PRR engagement on bone remodeling has been best described as a result of activated macrophages secreting effector molecules that reshape the characteristics of bone-resident cells. However, it is being increasingly recognized that local bone resident-cells like osteoclasts and osteoblasts possess an arsenal of PRRs. The engagement of these PRRs by stimuli in the bone niche can drive cell-autonomous (aka cell-intrinsic) responses that, in turn, impact bone-remodeling dramatically, irrespective of immune cell effectors. Indeed, this vital role for cell-autonomous innate immune responses is evident in how reduced PRR activity within osteoclast progenitors correlates with their reduced differentiation and abnormal bone remodeling. Further, cell-intrinsic PRR activity has now been shown to influence the behavior of osteoblasts, osteocytes and other local immune/non-immune cell populations. However, distinct PRR families have varying impact on bone homeostasis and inflammation, emphasizing the importance of investigating these different nodes of innate immune signaling in bone cells to better identify how they synergistically and/or antagonistically regulate bone remodeling in the course of an immune response. Summary: Innate immune sensing within bone resident cells is a critical determinant for bone remodeling in health and disease. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215544176

It consists of diverse cell types, extracellular matrix components, and signaling molecules that interact to promote tumor growth and therapeutic resistance. Elucidating the intricate interactions between cancer cells and the TME is crucial in understanding cancer progression and therapeutic challenges. A critical process induced by TME signaling is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), wherein epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal traits, which enhance their motility and invasiveness and promote metastasis and cancer progression. By targeting various components of the TME, novel investigational strategies aim to disrupt the TME’s contribution to the EMT, thereby improving treatment efficacy, addressing therapeutic resistance, and offering a nuanced approach to cancer therapy. This review scrutinizes the key players in the TME and the TME's contribution to the EMT, emphasizing avenues to therapeutically disrupt the interactions between the various TME components.

This study aimed to discuss the trends and annual rates of change in BMD and TBS with age in Chinese men with T2DM and men without diabetes mellitus. Lumbar spine(LS) TBS was significantly lower in males with T2DM compared to men without diabetes(1.279 ± 0.117 vs. 1.299 ± 0.090, P = 0.005). However, TBS in men with T2DM peaked around age 60, which occurred later and was lower than the peak observed in men without diabetes, who reached their peak TBS around age 50 (1.294 ± 0.126 vs. 1.328 ± 0.088). Femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine BMD in men with T2DM were not significantly different from those in men without diabetes. The results showed that both men with or without T2DM exhibited the lowest annual rates of change in TBS at 66–75 years of age, with values of -1.05%(P < 0.001) and − 0.90%(P < 0.001), respectively. Patients with great glycemic control demonstrated higher TBS and BMD. Men with T2DM have later and lower peak TBS and faster bone loss, suggesting that diabetes may negatively impact bone microarchitecture and mineralization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215356474

Methods: Micro-array datasets (GSE45006, GSE69334), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset (GSE151371), spatial transcriptome datasets (GSE214349, GSE184369), and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets (GSE162610, GSE226286) were available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis and differential expression analysis in GSE45006, we identified differentially expressed time- and immune-related genes (DETIRGs) associated with chronic SCI and differentially expressed ferroptosis- and immune-related genes (DEFIRGs), which were validated in GSE151371. Protein–protein interaction and microRNA-mRNA-transcription factor regulatory networks were constructed based on Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) and NetworkAnalyst, respectively, which were validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq). Cell subclusters and unique features of microglia in SCI were identified by single-cell transcriptomic analysis, which were validated in GSE226286. Spatial expression patterns of DETIRGs and DEFIRGs were validated in brain injury (GSE214349) and SCI (GSE184369). Potential mechanisms underlying neuronal regeneration by neurotrophin-3 (NT3)-chitosan were revealed by transcriptomic analyses in GSE69334.

A substantial body of evidence indicates that there is a complex relationship between obesity and OP, with a correlation between the occurrence of OP and obesity. In recent years, sirtuins have emerged as a prominent area of interest in the fields of aging and endocrine metabolism. Among the various research avenues exploring the potential of sirtuins, the effects of these proteins on obesity and OP have garnered significant attention from numerous researchers. Sirtuins regulate energy balance and lipid balance, which in turn inhibit the process of adipogenesis. Additionally, sirtuins regulate the balance between osteogenic and osteoblastic activity, which protects against the development of OP. However, no study has yet provided a comprehensive discussion of the relationship between the three: sirtuins, obesity, and OP. This paper will therefore describe the relationship between sirtuins and obesity, the relationship between sirtuins and OP, and a discussion focusing on the possibility of treating OP caused by obesity by targeting sirtuins. This will be based on the common influences on the occurrence of obesity and OP (such as mesenchymal stem cells, gut microbiota, and insulin). Finally, the potential of SIRT1, an important member of sirtuins, in polyphenolic natural products for the treatment of obesity and OP will be presented. This will contribute to a better understanding of the interactions between sirtuins and obesity and bone, which will facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for obesity and OP in the future. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215353117

Being transmitted by mosquitoes, this virus is associated with a range of illnesses and a small percentage of infected individuals might suffer from severe vascular leakage. This leakage leads to hypovolemic shock syndrome, generally known as dengue shock syndrome, organ failure, and bleeding complications. The severe form of this disease is believed to be, at least partially, associated with inflammatory and thrombotic states. These issues are significantly affected by the activation of platelets and leukocytes, as well as their interactions, which may influence its prognosis. The platelets present in a thrombus are able to attract leukocytes to the site of injury. The intricate process leads to the significant accumulation, activation, and migration of leukocytes, thereby promoting thrombotic events and triggering inflammatory responses. The occurrence of these events, combined with the direct viral infection of endothelial cells, leads to vascular endothelialitis, the disruption of cellular membranes, and the subsequent release of DAMPs. As a result, considerable damage occurs in the endothelium, which activates neutrophils and platelets; thisleads to their interaction and initiates the process of Netosis. Collectively, these processes exacerbate inflammatory and thrombotic conditions. In this respect, current research has focused on understanding whether effective anti-inflammatory protocols can prevent thrombotic events or, conversely, if efficient anticoagulant regimens may lead to a reduction in cytokine storms and tissue damage. This review article aims to illuminate the platelet leukocyte crosstalk, detailing the mechanisms through which platelets may play a role in the pathogenesis of DENV. The research outputs are particularly important in severe cases, in which case their interactions with leukocytes can exacerbate both inflammation and thrombosis in a mutually reinforcing manner. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215353006

Significant changes in gene expression often precede structural and functional alterations. Transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) are emerging as novel gene regulators, involved in various biological processes and human diseases. In this study, tsRNA-Gln-i-0095 was identified as a novel regulator, which was significantly upregulated in retinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Reducing the levels of tsRNA-Gln-i-0095 suppressed reactive gliosis, lowered inflammatory cytokine levels, and protected retinal ganglion cells from I/R injury. These effects led to reduced structural and functional damage, inhibited glial activation and inflammation, and enhanced neuronal function. Mechanistically, tsRNA-Gln-i-0095 downregulated the expression of NFIA and TGFBR2 through a miRNA-like mechanism.

To investigate the effect and mechanism of quercetin (Que) in anesthetized rats, the study provided a new therapeutic idea for the prevention of cognitive dysfunction caused by anesthesia. Methods: Cognitively impaired rats were constructed using Isoflurane (ISO) anesthesia and treated with Que. The capacity of the rats to learn and remember was tested using the Morris water maze test. Rat hippocampal tissues were collected and analyzed for inflammatory factor concentration and miR-138-5p expression using ELISA and qRT-PCR, respectively, and the targeting link between miR-138-5p and LCN2 was verified by dual luciferase reporter. Results: Que treatment was found to improve ISO-induced cognitive dysfunction and inhibit the level of hippocampal inflammatory factors in rats. miR-138-5p was down-regulated in rats with cognitive dysfunction, while Que treatment increased miR-138-5p expression. The study found that knockdown miR-138-5p can reverse the positive effects of Que therapy, aggravate cognitive dysfunction, and promote the secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the hippocampus. In addition, LCN2, a target gene of miR-138-5p, was significantly up-regulated in the hippocampus after ISO induction. Conclusion: Que may inhibit ISO-induced hippocampal neuroinflammation and ameliorate functional cognitive deficits in rats by modulating miR-138-5p/ LCN2. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215351289

Methods: Limbal niche cells (LNCs) were isolated from limbal tissues through enzymatic digestion and characterized. Conditioned medium from LNCs cultures was collected. KPCs were enriched by rapid adhesion of Matrigel and subsequently cultured in either an LNCs-conditioned medium supplemented with KSFM (LN-KS) or SHEM (LN-SH) for 14 days. Corneal-specific marker expression was assessed to evaluate transdifferentiation efficiency. Key transcription factors and signaling pathways involved in the transdifferentiation process were identified through single-cell and RNA sequencing, and were validated by western blot and quantitative real-time PCR. Results: Both LN-KS and LN-SH protocols successfully induced corneal epithelial cell transdifferentiation from KPCs, with LN-KS demonstrating higher efficiency in generating CK12 + and p63 + cells (p < 0.001). RNA sequencing analysis and western blot have revealed significant activation of STAT3 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Inhibition of STAT3 blocked the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and impaired corneal epithelial cell transdifferentiation.

Oxidative stress plays a dominant role in most skin diseases. Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic flower (TEA) is a traditional Chinese medicine widely used to treat injuries to the skin such as water and fire scalds. It has been reported that TEA has excellent antioxidant effects. In this study, we aimed to explore the antioxidant and mitochondrial protection effects of TEA in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-mediated HaCaT cell damage. HaCaT cells were incubated with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> to simulate oxidative stress in the skin. The effect of TEA on HaCaT cells was also evaluated. Cell morphology was observed via inverted microscopy, and cell viability was measured via the MTT reagent. The cells were stained with Hoechst 33,324 solution. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and ATP detection kits were used to detect the corresponding indicators. The mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by JC-1. RT-PCR was used to detect mRNA and mtDNA expression. The expression of the target protein was detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> triggered oxidative damage in HaCaT cells, which manifested as apoptosis, increased ROS and MDA contents, and decreased SOD activity. H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> activates the KEAP1/Nrf2/NQO1 signalling pathway, which decreases the expression of the intracellular KEAP1 protein and slightly increases the expression of the Nrf2 and NQO1 proteins, further causing mitochondrial oxidative stress, resulting in changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, a reduction in the mtDNA copy number, and decreased expression of the PGC-1α and TFAM proteins. In addition the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain genes and proteins decreased. TEA promoted the expression of Nrf2 in HaCaT cells, activated the downstream antioxidant response, and alleviated the oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage caused by H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. ML385 is an Nrf2 inhibitor, under which the antioxidant and mitochondrial protective effects of TEA are inhibited. When TFAM was knocked down, the protective effect of TEA on mitochondria was also inhibited.

This study aimed to investigate whether LINC01271 was involved in the process of fragility fractures and healing, providing a new perspective for its diagnosis and treatment. Methods: This study included 94 healthy individuals, 82 patients with osteoporosis, and 85 patients with fragility fractures as subjects. RT-qPCR was used to measure the levels of LINC01271, miR-19a-3p, PIK3CA, and osteogenic differentiation markers in osteoblasts and subjects’ serum. Luciferase reporter assays, RIP experiments, and RNA pull-down assays were utilized to verify the target relationships between LINC01271 and miR-19a-3p, as well as between miR-19a-3p and PIK3CA. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using CCK-8 assays and flow cytometry. Results: Compared to the healthy control group, the serum levels of LINC01271 were significantly reduced in patients with osteoporosis and fragility fractures. Furthermore, LINC01271 levels increased with time-dependent fracture healing. In vitro studies indicated that LINC01271 boosted osteoblast proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, and augmented osteogenic differences, whereas its inhibition reverses their effects. LINC01271 and PIK3CA were identified as targets of miR-19a-3p, and overexpression of miR-19a-3p could antagonize the effect of LINC01271 in promoting fracture healing.

However, the current understanding of TMJOA pathogenesis is limited and necessitates further research. Animal models are crucial for investigating TMJOA due to the scarcity of clinical samples. Class II malocclusion is an occlusal type highly associated with TMJOA, but it currently lacks appropriate animal models for simulating this malocclusion in research. Therefore, this study develops a new malocclusion model using a unilateral anterior large overjet (UALO) dental device to cause Class II malocclusion characteristics and TMJOA-like pathological alterations in rats. By inducing a posteriorly positioned condyle, the UALO device effectively results in cartilage degradation, subchondral bone loss, condylar volume reduction, and mandibular retrusion. Furthermore, RNA sequencing of condylar cartilages revealed that the oxidative stress of chondrocytes was elevated under the UALO-triggered abnormal mechanical stress. Disruption of antioxidant systems and mitochondrial dysfunction are involved in cartilage degeneration. The current study provides a novel and reliable rat model suitable for TMJOA research and offers insights into the disease’s potential mechanistic pathways and molecular targets, contributing to a deeper understanding of TMJOA. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215351164

However, critical-sized bone injuries have become increasingly prevalent, necessitating extensive medical interventions due to limitations in the body's capacity for self-repair. Traditional approaches, such as autografts, allografts, and xenografts, have yielded unsatisfactory results. Stem cell therapy emerges as a promising avenue, but challenges like immune rejection and low cell survival rates hinder its widespread clinical implementation. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have garnered attention for their regenerative capabilities, which surpass those of MSCs themselves. EVs offer advantages such as reduced immunogenicity, enhanced stability, and simplified storage, positioning them as a promising tool in stem cell-based therapies. This review explores the potential of EV-based therapy in bone tissue regeneration, delving into their biological characteristics, communication mechanisms, and preclinical applications across various physiological and pathological conditions. The mechanisms underlying EV-mediated bone regeneration, including angiogenesis, osteoblast proliferation, mineralization, and immunomodulation, are elucidated. Preclinical studies demonstrate the efficacy of EVs in promoting bone repair and neovascularization, even in pathological conditions like osteoporosis. EVs hold promise as a potential alternative for regenerating bone tissue, particularly in the context of critical-sized bone defects, offering new avenues for effective bone defect repair and management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215351149

However, complications such as nonunion have been reported to be as high as 30%. Recently, there have been reports demonstrating a percutaneous approach to be effective and safe. Methods: Forty-nine patients with end-stage hallux rigidus underwent percutaneous first MTP joint arthrodesis with calcaneus autograft performed by a single surgeon. Each patient underwent a minimum of 24 month clinical and radiographic follow up, including 3 month post operative computed tomography scans. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Foot Function Index (FFI) preoperatively and at final follow-up. Results: Mean follow-up was 27.3 months. Bone union was observed in 46 patients (93.9%). Mean time to union was 3.1 months. Nonunion rate was 6.1%. Overall complication rate was 12.2%. Mean pre- and postoperative VAS scores were 7.5 and 0.2, respectively (P <.0001). Mean pre- and postoperative total FFI values were 56.3 and 15.7 (P <.0001), respectively. Patient satisfaction after the procedure was 93.9%. Conclusion: Observed union rate is comparable to the average fusion rate previously reported for open and minimally invasive procedure union rates.

This study examined the relationships between AIP, TBS, and BMD in American adults using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, including the effect of obesity. Methods: Based on data from 3,162 Americans, multivariable logistic regression and a generalized additive model (GAM) were used to analyze AIP, BMD, and TBS. Mediation studies assessed the impact of obesity (BMI) on these relationships. A threshold effect study identified turning points. Results: The average participant age was 47.5 ± 17 years. AIP showed no correlation with BMD after BMI adjustment but was significantly associated with lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD without BMI adjustment. AIP negatively correlated with TBS even after adjusting for covariates. The relationship between AIP and TBS was L-shaped, with a turning point at -0.17. BMI mediated the AIP-BMD relationship by 122.01–131.49% (P < 0.05). Conclusions: This study found AIP levels associated with decreased TBS and increased BMD, influenced by obesity. AIP may be a valuable tool in evaluating bone metabolism, indicating high BMD but poor TBS, warranting further exploration. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215351028

To examine the association between perioperative methylprednisolone administration and postoperative pleural effusion and pneumonia in older patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Methods: A retrospective cohort study included non-small cell lung cancer patients aged 65 years or older undergoing thoracic surgery between January 2012 and December 2019 in China. Primary outcome was pleural effusion. Secondary outcome was postoperative pneumonia. Multivariate logistic regression models assessed the independent effects of various factors on pleural effusion and pneumonia. Propensity score matching (PSM) method reduced selection bias enhancing causal inference validity. Subgroup analyses identified potential effect heterogeneity in specific sub-populations. Results: A total of 1951 older patients with non-small cell lung cancer were included. The incidence of postoperative pleural effusion in the methylprednisolone group before and after PSM matching was significantly lower than that in the control group (before PSM: 9.4% vs. 19.2, P < 0.001; after PSM: 9.8% vs. 18.2%, P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of postoperative pneumonia between the two groups before and after matching. After adjusting all the variables and PSM, we found that intraoperative methylprednisolone was associated with a reduction in postoperative pleural effusion in older patients with non-small cell lung cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 0.48, P < 0.001; OR = 0.47, P < 0.001]. Perioperative methylprednisolone showed consistent protective effects in all sub-populations of gender, age, surgery duration, and smoking (P all < 0.05). Logistic regression models and PSM found that methylprednisolone was not associated with postoperative pneumonia and long-term survival in older patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Conclusion: Perioperative methylprednisolone was associated with reducing the occurrence of postoperative pleural effusions in older patients with non-small volume lung cancer, but it was not associated with pneumonia or long-term survival outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215351000

Ghrelin, a brain-gut hormone, has potential neuroprotective effects in AD. This study aimed to explore the potential mechanisms by which ghrelin regulates the progression of AD, as well as the crosstalk between microglial polarization and ferroptosis. Mouse BV2 microglial cells and male mice were treated with beta-amyloid (Aβ) (1–42) to simulate the AD environment. Microglia ferroptosis was measured by detecting levels of ferroptosis-related proteins (SLC7A11, GPX4, FTL1, and FTH1), metabolic markers (ROS, MDA, GSH, SOD), and observing mitochondrial morphological changes. Microglial polarization was evaluated by measuring levels of inflammatory markers and surface markers. The impact of ghrelin on Aβ<inf>1−42</inf>-exposed microglia was assessed by coupling with the ferroptosis activator Erastin. Cognitive impairment in AD mice was evaluated through behavioral tests. Tissue staining was applied to determine neuronal damage. In Aβ<inf>1−42</inf>-exposed microglia, ghrelin upregulated the protein expression of SLC7A11, GPX4, FTL1 and FTH1, reduced ROS and MDA levels, and elevated GSH and SOD levels through the BMP6/SMAD1 pathway. Ghrelin alleviated mitochondrial structural damage. Additionally, ghrelin reduced levels of pro-inflammatory factors and CD86, while increasing levels of anti-inflammatory factors and CD206. Erastin reversed the effects of ghrelin on ferroptosis and phenotypic polarization in Aβ<inf>1−42</inf>-exposed microglia. In AD mice, ghrelin ameliorated abnormal behavior, neuroinflammation, and plaque deposition. Ghrelin attenuated iNOS/IBA1-positive expression and enhanced Arg-1/IBA1-positive expression in the hippocampus. Ghrelin induces microglial M2 polarization by inhibiting microglia ferroptosis, thereby alleviating neuroinflammation. Our results indicate that ghrelin may serve as a promising potential agent for treating cognitive impairment in AD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215350968

Techniques such as ALP staining, ALP activity assay, western blot, RT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining were utilized to examine the influence of ARC expression levels on the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and the osteoclastic differentiation of Raw264.7 cell lines. Mitophagy flux levels in BMSCs were detected using the mitophagy detection kit. RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were conducted to explore potential mechanisms of ARC regulation in BMSCs osteogenic differentiation. To sum up, 17β-estradiol can modulate bone homeostasis by adjusting ARC expression.

The changes can be rapid and are thought to be caused by chemotherapy, antibiotics, or intestinal inflammation. Most patients are exposed to prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics during neutropenia and several patients are colonized by ESBL bacteria. We investigated the changes in gut microbiota composition in allo-HSCT, aiming at investigating if the acquisition of ESBL colonization may affect gut microbiome diversity during allo-HSCT. This was a single-center prospective pilot study. All patients consecutively admitted to the Haematological Unit of the City of Health and Science, Molinette Hospital in Turin, Italy, and undergoing allo-HSCT between August 2017 to August 2020 were enrolled in the study. Microbiome analysis on fecal samples were collected every 7 days from hospital admission to discharge and until 1 year after HSCT. 48 patients were enrolled in the study. At baseline 14 patients (29.16%) were colonized by MDR bacteria, mostly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram negatives (N = 11; 78.57%). During allo-HSCT, one patient had a positive rectal swab for a carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and eight patients lost the colonization during the hospital stay. Microbiota composition was compared between patients colonized by ESBL at baseline and non-colonized patients. Patients colonized by ESBL had a greater abundances of Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Clostridium, Coprococcus, L-Ruminococcus Mogibacteriaceae, Peptostreptococceae and Oscillospira, while non-colonized ESBL patients had a greater abundance of Actinomycetales, Staphylococcus and Sutterella. Moreover, microbiota composition of colonized by ESBL that retained colonization after HSCT showed an increased in abundances of Akkermansia, Dialister, Erysipelotrichaceae and Methanobrevibacter when compared with patients that become negative at rectal swabs. From a clinical perspective, the evolution of this prospective pilot study will be to investigate markers of gut barrier functions, SCFA productions and to correlate the predictivity of these parameters with risk of invasive infections and clinical outcomes in allo-HSCT population. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215135069

The contribution of BMP receptors in defining tip-cell characteristics is poorly understood. Our study combines genetic, biochemical, and molecular methods together with 3D traction force microscopy, which reveals an essential role of BMPR2 for actin-driven filopodia formation and mechanical properties of endothelial cells (ECs). Targeting of Bmpr2 reduced sprouting angiogenesis in zebrafish and BMPR2-deficient human ECs formed fewer filopodia, affecting cell migration and actomyosin localization. Spheroid assays revealed a reduced sprouting of BMPR2-deficient ECs in fibrin gels. Even more strikingly, in mosaic spheroids, BMPR2-deficient ECs failed to acquire tip-cell positions. Yet, 3D traction force microscopy revealed that these distinct cell behaviors of BMPR2-deficient tip cells cannot be explained by differences in force-induced matrix deformations, even though these cells adopted distinct cone-shaped morphologies. Notably, BMPR2 positively regulates local CDC42 activity at the plasma membrane to promote filopodia formation.

In this study, we have examined the relaxation properties of asphalt binders through relaxation tests conducted on asphalt and its mastic under different conditions. A repeated stress relaxation-recovery test is designed for assessing both the relaxation and elastic properties, and a set of reasonable test parameters is recommended, thereby establishing a novel test method for measuring the relaxation and elastic behaviors of asphalt. In addition, we have proposed evaluation indexes, such as relaxation time, relaxation rate, and strain recovery rate, to assess the stress relaxation performance and strain recovery ability. It is observed that the relaxation rate and strain recovery rate of the material can be used to characterize the material’s relaxation and elasticity properties, respectively. Thus, the proposed indexes can be used to comprehensively evaluate the viscoelastic performance of the material. The fatigue performance of the selected materials is further examined using the linear amplitude sweep (LAS) test, and the correlation between the relaxation properties and fatigue performance (as indicated by fatigue parameters) is explored. Furthermore, a fatigue performance prediction equation based on the repetitive stress relaxation-recovery test is established.

Recent studies emphasized the crucial involvement of the immune system, especially T cells, in driving tumor progression and influencing patient outcomes. The emerging field of immunometabolism has shown that metabolic pathways play a pivotal role in regulating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. This study aims to clarify the relationships between specific T cell phenotypes, circulating metabolites, and malignant brain tumors. Methods: We utilized a multiple mendelian randomization approach to investigate the associations between T cell phenotypes and malignant brain tumors, as well as the role of plasma metabolites in mediating these interactions. Instrumental variables were selected based on stringent criteria, and multiple mendelian randomization methods were utilized to identify causal pathways and metabolites potentially mediating these effects. Results: Our analysis identified significant associations between seven distinct T cell phenotypes, including various CD8 + and regulatory T cell subsets, and the presence of malignant brain tumors. We also identified 87 plasma metabolites correlated with these tumors. Notably, metabolites such as octadecanedioylcarnitine (C18-DC) and eicosanedioate (C20-DC) were implicated in modulating the risk of developing malignant brain tumors. Furthermore, metabolites such as 5-dodecenoate (12:1n7) and arachidonate (20:4n6) were found to influence tumor risk, particularly in relation to CD28 − CD8 + T cells.

M1 microglia induce inflammation and exert neurotoxic effects, whereas M2 microglia exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. The sine oculis homeobox (SIX) gene family consists of six members, including sine oculis homeobox homolog 1 (SIX1)-SIX6. SIX1 is expressed in microglia and promotes inflammation. This study aimed to evaluate the role and underlying mechanisms of SIX1 in microglia polarization in vitro (LPS-treated mouse microglia; BV2 cells) and in vivo (a mouse model of SCI). SIX1 expression was increased in the microglia of mice with SCI. SIX1 was positively correlated with the M1 microglia marker inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and negatively correlated with the M2 microglia marker arginase 1 (Arg1) in mice with SCI. Knockdown of SIX1 promoted functional recovery by enhancing M2 microglia polarization in mice with SCI. The transcription, expression, and activity of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) were decreased in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. Downregulation of EZH2 promoted SIX1 expression in LPS-treated BV2 cells by inhibiting the methylation of the SIX1 promoter. SIX1 enhanced the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells with downregulated EZH2. VEGF-C promoted M1 polarization and inhibited M2 polarization in BV2 cells by binding to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3). Overall, the results suggest that SIX1 promotes M1 polarization of microglia following SCI by upregulating the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 axis, whereas the blockade of SIX1 can improve the recovery of locomotor function following SCI, demonstrating a novel strategy for the treatment of SCI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215081339

Over the past decade, extensive studies have revealed critical roles of the tumour microenvironment (TME) in cancer initiation, progression, and drug resistance. Notably, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have emerged as one of the primary contributors in shaping TME, creating a favourable environment for cancer development. Many preclinical studies have identified promising targets on CAFs, demonstrating remarkable efficacy of some CAF-targeted treatments in preclinical models. Encouraged by these compelling findings, therapeutic strategies have now advanced into clinical evaluation. We aim to provide a comprehensive review of relevant subjects on CAFs, including CAF-related markers and targets, their multifaceted roles, and current landscape of ongoing clinical trials.

They possess various metabolic and quality control mechanisms crucial for maintaining normal cellular activities. Mitochondrial genetic disorders can arise from a wide range of mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear DNA, which encode mitochondrial proteins or other contents. These genetic defects can lead to a breakdown of mitochondrial function and metabolism, such as the collapse of oxidative phosphorylation, one of the mitochondria’s most critical functions. Mitochondrial diseases, a common group of genetic disorders, are characterized by significant phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Clinical symptoms can manifest in various systems and organs throughout the body, with differing degrees and forms of severity. The complexity of the relationship between mitochondria and mitochondrial diseases results in an inadequate understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation of these diseases, historically making diagnosis and treatment challenging and often leading to unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. However, recent advancements in research and technology have significantly improved our understanding and management of these conditions. Clinical translations of mitochondria-related therapies are actively progressing. This review focuses on the physiological mechanisms of mitochondria, the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases, and potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Additionally, this review discusses future perspectives on mitochondrial genetic diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214946094

Methods: A total analyzed 51 adult participant with mature single rooted teeth having necrotic pulp with chronic periapical periodontitis (PAI ≥ 3) were selected. Patients had been randomly categorized into three distinct groups (n = 17 each group). All groups received the same treatment on the first visit. After 2 weeks, regenerative treatment was performed using either blood clot technique, Standard-PRF and Advanced-PRF approach. A standardized radiograph was taken, and the patients instructed for 6, 12 and 18 months follow up periods. Fisher's exact test was applied to compare the frequency of PAI scores at different follow-up intervals between the three groups. Results: The results showed radiographic success at 18 months (58.8% in blood group, 94.1% in S-PRF group and 76.5% in A-PRF group). There was no statistically significant difference between the three groups according to incidence of healing at 6, 12 and 18 months. Clinical success was 82.4% in blood group and 88.2% in both S-PRF and A-PRF groups. There was no significant difference between the three groups (p = 1). The overall success (clinical and radigraphic) was 76.5%. Incidence of the gaining sensitivity after 12 and 18 months was 29.4% with A-PRF group and 41.2% within the S-PRF group, 17.6% with BC group. Conclusion: PRF based regenerative technique may outperform the blood clot technique in treatment of non-vital mature teeth with chronic periapical periodontitis. There is a need for future randomized clinical studies to consolidate procedures in this field with more prolonged evaluation periods.

Semen, being a crucial indicator of male sexual maturity and fertility, significantly influences the performance of breeding boars. The molecular basis for comprehending the fecundity of boars in practical production lies in understanding the disparities in sperm proteins among boars of varying ages. In this investigation, spermatozoa from three one-year-old and three seven-year-old Wannan black pigs were individually chosen. Employing a tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics approach, a total of 4050 proteins were identified, out of which 130 proteins exhibited significant differences between the two groups. GO enrichment analysis revealed that these proteins primarily participated in energy metabolism, spermatogenesis, fertilization, and reproduction. KEGG enrichment analysis demonstrated that the differential proteins predominantly resided within the ribosome pathway. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to identify core proteins such as Small ribosomal subunit protein uS7 (RPS5). Ultimately, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was conducted on the selected differential proteins to validate result accuracy.

The declined osteogenic ability of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) induced by inflammation stimulus contributes to reduced capacity to regenerate periodontal bone, which brings about a huge challenge for treating periodontitis. Here, inspired by the adhesive property of mussels, we have created adhesive and mineralized hydrogel microspheres loaded with traditional compound cordycepin (MMS-CY). MMS-CY could adhere to the surface of alveolar bone, then promote the migration capacity of PDLSCs and thus recruit them to inflammatory periodontal tissues. Furthermore, MMS-CY rescued the impaired osteogenesis and ligament-forming capacity of PDLSCs, which were suppressed by the inflammation stimulus. Moreover, MMS-CY also displayed the excellent inhibitory effect on the osteoclastic activity. Mechanistically, MMS-CY inhibited the premature senescence induced by the inflammation stimulus through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2) pathway and reducing the DNA injury. Utilizing in vivo rat periodontitis model, MMS-CY was demonstrated to enhance the periodontal bone regeneration by improving osteogenesis and inhibiting the osteoclastic activity. Altogether, our study indicated that the multi-pronged approach is promising to promote the periodontal bone regeneration in periodontitis condition by reducing the inflammation-induced stem cell senescence and maintaining bone homeostasis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214909822

It is classified into six types: severe perinatal, benign prenatal, infantile, pediatric, adult, and odonto. HPP with femoral hypoplasia on fetal ultrasonography, seizures, or early loss of primary teeth can be easily diagnosed. In contrast, pediatric, adult, and odonto types of HPP over 4 years of age are less likely to be diagnosed because they do not have typical symptoms. Consequently, it may be misdiagnosed as common osteoporosis, and treatments incompatible with HPP may be implemented. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of bisphosphonate preparations administration on the femur of Akp2+/− mice, a mild-type HPP mice model. Zoledronic acid (Zol) was subcutaneously administered to 4-week-old Akp2+/− mice at 1 mg/kg (volume: 200 μL) once a week for a total of 5 times.

Additionally, micro-computed tomography (CT) analysis, histological analysis, and analysis of the expression levels of various marker proteins and genes were performed. Age-matched Akp2+/+ mice served as controls. The results demonstrated that the administration of Zol to Akp2+/− mice, compared to Akp2+/+ mice, insufficiently promotive bone formation, torn femoral head cartilage, and decreased spontaneous locomotor activity.

Exosomes play a vital role in cell-to-cell communication within the TME. Hypoxic TME have a great impact on the release, uptake and biofunctions of exosomes. This study aims to elucidate the communication between BMSC-derived exosomal miRNA and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in a hypoxic environment. Methods: Exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation and identified using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and western blot. A range of bioinformatics approaches were used to screen exosomal miRNAs and the target mRNAs of miRNAs and predict the possible signaling pathways. Expression levels of genes and proteins were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were analyzed using CCK-8 assay, EDU assay, transwell migration, wound healing assay and invasion assay, respectively. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to confirm the binding between miRNAs and the target mRNAs. The impact of hypoxic BMSC-derived exosomal miRNA on TNBC progression in vivo was evaluated using tumor xenograft nude mouse models. Furthermore, the impact of patients’ serum exosomal miRNA on TNBC was implemented. Results: Exosomes derived from hypoxic BMSCs promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of TNBC and suppresses the apoptosis of TNBC. The expression of miR-210-3p in BMSC-derived exosomes is markedly elevated in hypoxic conditions. Exosome-mediated transfer of miR-210-3p from hypoxic BMSCs to TNBC targets NFIX and activates Wnt/β-Catenin signaling in TNBC. Deletion of miR-210-3p in hypoxic BMSC-derived exosomes attenuates TNBC in vivo. Additionally, human exosomal miR-210-3p from the serum of TNBC patients promotes TNBC progression. Moreover, we notably observed a marked downregulation of NFIX expression levels in cancerous tissues compared to paracancerous tissues. Conclusions: Hypoxic BMSC-derived exosomal miR-210-3p promotes TNBC progression via NFIX-Wnt/β-catenin signaling axis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214878398

Recent clinical tests have indicated that the regulation of PS fibroblast cells (PSF cells) proliferation can serve as an intervention measure for PS. Our work aimed to elucidate the specific mechanism of action of TCF4 on the progression of PS fibrosis. Methods: Our study used qRT-PCR and Western blot to search for the expression of key proteins in PS clinical samples and cells. Transwell, CCK-8, and wound scratch assays were employed to analyze the proliferation and migration of PSF cells. CHIP, dual-luciferase reporter experiments, and bio-informatics analysis were used to analyze the interactions between molecules. Results: The analysis of PS clinical samples confirmed a positive correlation between TCF4 and miR-494-3p. This regulatory mechanism was related to the progression of PS. We verified that the overexpression of miR-494-3p or the knockdown of THBS1 both suppressed the proliferation and migration of PSF cells. Furthermore, we also confirmed the binding relationships between TCF4, miR-494-3p, and THBS1. Simultaneously, we verified the existence of the TCF4/miR-494-3p/THBS1 regulatory network in PS. This regulatory process affects the development of PS fibrosis. Conclusion: Our study results indicate that TCF4, miR-494-3p, and THBS1 are abnormally expressed in PS. TCF4 increases the proliferation and migration ability of PSF cells through the miR-494-3p/THBS1 signaling pathway, which promotes the fibrosis of PS. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214876843

The disruption of BBB is associated with the progression of cerebral diseases. Pterostilbene is a natural compound found in blueberries and grapes with a wide range of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-diabetic effects. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of pterostilbene on LPS-stimulated mouse brain endothelial (bEnd.3) cells and underlying mechanisms. The results showed that pterostilbene effectively upregulated the expressions of tight junction (TJ) proteins such as zonula occludens (ZO)-1 and claudin-5 and downregulated the expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, preventing BBB damage under LPS stimulation. Pterostilbene decreased the LPS-triggered expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 as well as the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and nitric oxide (NO). Meanwhile, we found that pterostilbene exerted an inhibitory effect on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in bEnd.3 cells upon LPS stimulation. Additionally, pterostilbene exhibited antioxidant effects by activating heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). These findings indicated that pterostilbene protected against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption in bEnd.3 cells. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214867322

The PAMI-ED ALT program employed a multifaceted approach in the Emergency Department (ED) developing electronic health record (EHR) pain management order panels and discharge panels, as well as educating patients, clinicians, and ED staff on opioid alternatives, including non-pharmacologic interventions. The primary objective of this analysis was to compare changes in opioid and non-opioid analgesic administrations and prescribing in ED patients with select pain conditions (renal colic, headache, low back, and non-low back musculoskeletal pain) before and after implementation of PAMI ED-ALT. Secondary outcomes included characterizing changes in 30-day ED all-cause recidivism and hospital all-cause admissions within these pain populations. Methods: Demographics, opioid and opioid alternative utilization, hospital admission, 30-day ED returns and change in pain intensity score were collected from January 2019-March 2020 (pre-program implementation) and January 2021-March 2023 (post-program implementation) for both the ED aggregate and program target pain populations. Results: Pain management order panel utilization increased throughout the post-implementation period. When comparing pre to post program data, there was a reduction in opioid administrations and prescriptions for most of the target pain conditions, as well as within the ED aggregate population. Opioid alternative administrations and prescriptions increased for all pain conditions except renal colic. Hospital admissions decreased significantly amongst those with low back pain and headache/migraine and 30-day ED returns significantly declined in those with musculoskeletal pain. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate an opioid-alternatives program implemented within a safety-net hospital system serving a predominantly socially disadvantaged patient population can lead to changes in ED pain management and potentially reduce 30-day ED recidivism and hospitalizations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214397940

One common strategy to prevent adhesion formation is the use of physical barriers. This study aimed to compare the outcomes of extensor tendon repair with and without the application of the OrthoWrap® bioresorbable Sheet, specifically in terms of adhesion prevention. Methods: This triple-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted on patients with trauma to the extensor zone VI tendons. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In the intervention group, OrthoWrap® bioresorbable Sheet was applied in addition to the standard tendon repair protocol. Over a three-month follow-up period, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, extension lag, and metacarpophalangeal joint flexion were assessed. Additionally, the mobility of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints was evaluated using the Strickland classification. Results: A total of 42 patients in the OrthoWrap® group and 43 in the control group were evaluated over the three-month period. Both groups showed a significant reduction in mean extension lag at the metacarpophalangeal joint over time. No significant condition-by-time interactions were found for MP joint flexion or VAS scores (p > 0.05). However, significant improvements in MP joint flexion and VAS scores were observed over time. The OrthoWrap® group demonstrated significantly more favorable outcomes compared to the control group. Conclusion: The clinical application of OrthoWrap® in extensor tendon repair demonstrated statistically significant but modest improvements in extension lag (2.5°). While patients treated with OrthoWrap® showed better outcomes in Strickland’s classification, the clinical significance of these small differences and their impact on patient function requires further investigation.

For cancer cells, analysis of cell cycle-related events is of paramount significance since tumorigenesis is characteristically coupled to cell cycle perturbations. RT-qPCR is a highly sensitive technique to investigate cell cycle-dependent transcriptional regulation. However, for reliable evaluation of qPCR data reference genes with stable mRNA expression are required. Although several studies investigating cell cycle-dependent gene expression employ frequently used reference genes, the suitability of these reference genes has not been thoroughly investigated so far. Moreover, such potential reference genes for cell cycle analysis have not been described in the literature. Therefore, we aimed to identify reference genes characterized with stable expression throughout the cell cycle in MOLT4 and U937 human leukemia cell lines synchronized with RO-3306 CDK1 inhibitor using RT-qPCR. Here we show that for cell cycle-dependent gene expression analysis the commonly used TBP is suitable, while the recently recognized reference genes SNW1 and CNOT4 are applicable in a cell line-dependent manner. We also suggest that proper selection of reference genes for each experimental condition is crucial for reliable normalization as these aspects can severely compromise conclusions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214282897

However, the precise mechanisms through which exosome-related genes (ERGs) influence PD remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role and potential mechanisms of key exosome-related genes in PD using transcriptome profiling at the single-cell level. Methods: The current study cited GSE16134, GSE10334, GSE171213 datasets and 19,643 ERGs. Initially, differential expression analysis, three machine learning (ML) models, gene expression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were proceeded to identify core genes. Subsequently, a core gene-based artificial neural network (ANN) model was built to evaluate the predictive power of core genes for PD. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and immunoinfiltration analysis were conducted based on core genes. To pinpoint key cell types influencing the progression of periodontal at the single-cell level, a series of single-cell analyses covering pseudo-time series analysis were accomplished. The expression verification of core genes was performed through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: CKAP2, IGLL5, MZB1, CXCL6, and AADACL2 served as core genes diagnosing PD. Four core gene were elevated in the PD group in addition to down-regulated AADACL2. The core gene-based-ANN model had AUC values of 0.909 in GSE16134 dataset, which exceeded AUC of each core gene, highlighting the accurately and credibly predictive performance of ANN model. GSEA revealed that ribosome was co-enriched by 5 core genes, manifesting the expression of these genes might be critical for protein structure or function. Immunoinfiltration analysis found that CKAP2, IGLL5, MZB1, and CXCL6 exhibited positive correlations with most discrepant immune cells/discrepant stromal cells, which were highly infiltrated in PD. B cells and T cells holding crucial parts in PD were identified as key cell types. Pseudo-time series analysis revealed that the expression of IGLL5 and MZB1 increased during T cell differentiation, increased and then decreased during B cell differentiation. The qRT-PCR proved the mRNA expression levels of CKAP2 and MZB1 were increased in the blood of PD patients compared to controls. But the mRNA expression levels of AADACL2 was decreased in the PD patients compared to controls. This is consistent with the trend in the amount of expression in the dataset. Conclusion: CKAP2, IGLL5, MZB1, CXCL6 and AADACL2 were identified as core genes associated with exosomes, helping us to understand the role of these genes in PD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214280279

According to different factors, arthritis can be divided into osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and so on. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common internal modification of eukaryotic mRNA and is involved in splicing, stabilization, output and degradation of RNA metabolism. This review systematically summarized current insights into the mechanism of m6A in arthritis. Methods: The studies related to the involvement of m6A in the pathogenesis of arthritis reported in PubMed, Google scholar, and other open source literatures were investigated to evaluate the important roles of m6A in arhtritis, and the clinical relevances. Results and conclusions: M6A methylation regulators play the roles of writers, erasers, and readers, are crucial for regulating gene expression, and play important roles in many biological processes such as virus replication and cell differentiation. In addition, more and more studies have shown that m6A is closely related to the development of arthritis. As a new therapeutic target for arthritis, m6A has a wide influence on the pathological mechanism of arthritis. However, further research is needed to determine how m6A affects arthritis pathology and its use in target therapy and diagnosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214277773

However, little is known about the extent to which physiotherapists adhere to clinical practice guidelines. This study aimed to explore the perspectives and care patterns of physiotherapists in Sydney, Australia on their delivery of knee osteoarthritis care and how this aligns with the 2019 Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) guidelines. Methods: We invited thirty-three physiotherapists from nine private practices in metropolitan Sydney to partake in a semi-structured interview. The interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data collected were analysed deductively using content analysis, comparing guidelines to current care patterns, while their perspectives were inductively analysed through thematic analysis. Results: Thirty physiotherapists participated (age range 22–63 years, 17 male and 13 female). Interview responses indicated that most physiotherapists were satisfied with their care of knee osteoarthritis patients. Most physiotherapists delivered “core” guideline-based care of education and land-based exercise. Recommendations of modalities of exercise, including hydrotherapy and manual therapy, were discussed and were perceived to be beneficial despite not being “core” clinical guideline recommendations. Current treatment strategies focussed on disease severity, symptom presentation and/or patient exercise history with little emphasis on education about osteoarthritis pathophysiology and drug-based pain relief. The thematic analysis identified two over-arching themes; (1) capacity to deliver and awareness of evidence-based care and (2) perceived recommendations for future physiotherapy management. Participants identified notable areas of potential service improvement including developing stronger and more effective reimbursement models, increased consult times and improved patient access. Conclusion: The study provided unique insights towards physiotherapists’ current usual knee osteoarthritis care and their perceived barriers to delivering guideline-based care. Thus, informing a need for future studies to focus on developing specific and detailed guidelines if physiotherapists are to align more closely to the core guideline-based recommendations.

Leydig cells (LCs) transplantation is considered to be one of a viable approach for LOH therapy, but the limited source of LCs limits the application of this approach. The aim of this study was to induce the directed differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into LCs in vitro, and explore the potential involvement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the differentiation process. BMSCs were extracted from rats and characterized by flow cytometry for positive rates of mesenchymal stem cell markers CD29, CD44, CD90, and the hematopoietic marker CD45. BMSCs were divided into three groups: Control, Wnt agonist (CHIR-99021), and Wnt inhibitor (LGK-974), each incubated for 14 days. ELISA and RT-qPCR were used to verify the protein and mRNA expression of β-catenin, LRP5 and TCF, the key factors in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The average fluorescence intensity of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) on the surface of LCs was detected by immunofluorescence (IF) assay. The content of testosterone secreted in cell culture medium was detected by ELISA. The results of flow cytometry indicated that we successfully extracted and cultured BMSCs. Moreover, post 14 days of incubation, the changes of β-catenin, LRP5 and TCF, at the protein and mRNA level demonstrate successful intervention in the activation and inhibition of the intracellular Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Compared with the control group, the LCs surface marker 3β-HSD expression intensity in the CHIR-99,021 group was significantly increased by 69% (p < 0.01), while significantly decreased by 59% in LGK-974 group (p < 0.01). The ELISA results indicated a higher testosterone concentration in the CHIR-99,021 group (359.58 ± 17.46 pg/mL) than in the control (225.31 ± 15.42 pg/mL) and LGK-974 groups (183.67 ± 4.47 pg/mL), and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). This study successfully demonstrates the directed differentiation of BMSCs into LCs under the action of inducers. We verified that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in this differentiation process. The idea proposed in our study for efficiently inducing differentiation of BMSCs into LC in vitro, may provide a safe and sustainable LC source for developing clinically feasible cell transplantation-based LOH therapies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214270056

Aging and mitochondrial dysfunction are involved in the onset and progression of OP, but the specific mechanisms have not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to identify novel potential biomarkers associated with aging and mitochondria in OP. In this study, based on GEO database, aging-related and mitochondria-related differentially expressed genes (AR&MRDEGs) were screened. The AR&MRDEGs were enriched in mitochondrial structure and function. Then, 6 key genes were identified by WGCNA and multiple machine learning, and a novel diagnostic model was constructed. The efficacy of diagnostic model was validated using external datasets. The results showed that diagnostic model had favorable diagnostic prediction ability. Next, key gene regulatory networks were constructed and single-gene GSEA analysis was performed.

One of the regions most affected by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is the hippocampus, specifically the CA1 area, which is highly susceptible to ischemia. Previous studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory properties of quercetin. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of quercetin on hippocampal CA1 neurons following MCAO. Materials and methods: Fifty-six male Albino Wistar rats were divided into seven groups (intact, sham, stroke, vehicle, and three quercetin-treated groups receiving 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, respectively), each containing 8 rats. Various assessments, including brain water content, the rotarod test, the Bederson neurological score, the Morris water maze (MWM) test, the shuttle box test, histopathological evaluations, and measurements of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels, were conducted across the groups. Results: Compared with control rats, 5 and 10 mg/kg quercetin-treated rats presented significant improvements in brain water content, neurological function, and motor function and improved performance in the MWM and shuttle box tests. Histopathological analyses revealed better preservation of CA1 neurons in these groups. Additionally, IL-10 levels significantly increased, whereas IL-1β levels significantly decreased. However, the group receiving 20 mg/kg quercetin showed no statistically significant changes in the parameters assessed (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Quercetin may help prevent or ameliorate brain injuries caused by acute stroke, suggesting its neuroprotective effects. The reduction in IL-1β and increase in IL-10 may play key roles in quercetin’s protective mechanism. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214234097

In this study, coal gangue powder was added to prepare Emulsified Asphalt Mastic (EAM) to improve the rheological properties and fatigue performance. A series of tests, including frequency scanning, temperature scanning, Multiple Stress Creep Recovery (MSCR), Linear Amplitude Scanning (LAS), and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were conducted. Through rheology theory, viscoelastic damage theory, the impact of three fillers: Coal Gangue Powder (CGP), Limestone Powder (LP) and Portland Cement (PC), as well as four kinds of Powder-Binder ratios (P/B) (0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5) on the high temperature rheology and medium temperature fatigue performance of EAM was analyzed. The findings reveal that the filler content has a great influence on the proportion of viscoelastic components of EAM in the low frequency domain. The complex shear modulus (G*) and phase angle (δ) of EAM were suitable for Christensen-Anderson-Marasteanu model (CAM) model in the wide frequency domain. Increasing the filler content and Rotating Thin Film Oven Test (RTFOT) aging can improve the high-temperature stability and stress sensitivity of EAM, but it reduced its fatigue resistance. The high temperature performance of EAM containing PC and CGP exhibit superior high-temperature performance compared to LP fillers. Conversely, LP mastic demonstrate superior anti-fatigue performance under actual strain levels in both thin and thick asphalt pavement layers, surpassing the performance of PC mastic and CGP mastic. Therefore, coal gangue powder can be used as a new type of green filler to replace limestone powder. An appropriate amount of incorporation can improve the high temperature stability of the mortar and does not have a huge impact on the fatigue performance. The most suitable range of P/B is identified as 0.6–1.0 when utilizing LP as the filler, 1.2–1.5 when utilizing PC or CGP as the filler. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214231813

The study aims to explore the differences in aggression levels among these groups to understand the impact of incarceration and sports participation on aggression. Methods: The participants included in the analysis consist of prisoners (n = 363) housed in Marmara No. 7 and No. 3 Type L Closed Penal Institutions, who have been incarcerated for intentional injury, with an average age of 36.64 ± 10.30 years and an average custody period of 980.47 ± 1335.27 days. Amateur combat athletes (n = 203) with an average age of 25.17 ± 10.09 years have been actively engaged in sports for an average of 11.83 ± 9.53 years. The control group (n = 329) has an average age of 32.65 ± 7.56 years. Data collection instruments included a personal information form and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0, with a significance level set at p < 0.05. Results: Analysis of the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire scores revealed that the aggression levels of prisoners incarcerated for intentional injury were statistically significantly lower than those of both amateur combat athletes and control group participants (p < 0.001). Additionally, a significant reduction in overall aggression scores was observed among prisoners as the number of days in custody increased (p = 0.045). No significant differences were found among amateur combat athletes concerning the discipline variable, and no meaningful relationship was identified between years of active sports participation and aggression scores. Conclusion: The findings indicate that educational, social, and sports activities organized in correctional facilities can be effective in reducing aggression levels among inmates.

The present investigation was performed to assess the protective effects of Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) leaf extract on cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced ovarian damage and reproductive dysfunction. Thirty-two female, healthy Wistar albino rats were randomly assigned to four groups (8 rats/group). The first group was given saline intraperitoneally (i.p.). The second group was given a single dose of CP (200 mg/kg; i.p.). The third and fourth groups were given M. oleifera leaf extract (150 and 250 mg/kg; orally) for 20 days before receiving CP on the final day of the experiment. Hormonal assessments, including follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estrogen (ES), were performed 24 h after CP administration. In addition, the antioxidant status and inflammatory response against CP were evaluated. Moreover, detailed histopathological and ultra- structural observations were conducted. For evaluation of statistical significance between different groups; One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc test was adopted. Our findings revealed that rats subjected to CP showed increased levels of FSH, LH, malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-8 and decreased levels of ES and glutathione. Pre-treatment with M. oleifera leaf extract (250 mg/kg; orally) was statistically significant (p values < 0.05) as it could improve hormonal changes, oxidative stress indices, and pro- inflammatory mediator levels. Consequently, a marked improvement was observed in the ovarian and uterine architectures, with a normal ovarian reserve and a normal endothelium with normal tubular glands. In conclusion, M. oleifera leaf extract (250 mg/kg) could be used as a pharmaceutical supplement because it protects female rats against CP-induced ovarian damage and reproductive dysfunction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214218429

Methods: A model was established combining high-fat diet (HFD)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice with myocardial infarction. The therapeutic effects of transplanted wild-type EPC, Nlrp3 knockout EPC, and Nlrp3 overexpression EPC were evaluated. Chip and Luciferase assay revealed CEBPB regulated the transcriptional expression of Nlrp3 as a transcription factor in EPC stimulated by high glucose (HG) or advanced glycation end products (AGEs). CO-IP results suggested that USP14 selectively suppressed NLRP3 degradation. KEGG enrichment revealed PI3K/ Akt/mTOR signaling showed striking significance in the entire pathway. Results: In our study, wild-type, Nlrp3 knockout and Nlrp3 overexpressed EPC, intracardiac injections effectively improved cardiac function, increased angiogenesis, and reduced infarct size in mice with myocardial infarction. However, in the HFD/STZ-induced diabetic mice model combined with myocardial infarction, Nlrp3 knockout EPC significantly restored angiogenic capacity. Mechanically, CEBPB regulated the transcriptional level of Nlrp3 as a transcription factor in EPC. Meanwhile, we found that USP14 selectively suppressed NLRP3 protein degradation through the USP motif on the NACHT domain in mediating inflammasome activation. Cardiac functional outcomes in recipient mice after intramyocardial injection of shNlrp3 EPC overexpressing CEBPB or USP14 validated the modulation of EPC function by regulating Nlrp3 transcription or post-translational modification. Furthermore, KEGG enrichment and validation at the protein levels revealed PI3K/ Akt/mTOR cascade might be a downstream signal for NLRP3 inflammasome. Conclusion: Our study provides a new understanding of how diabetes affected progenitor cell-mediated cardiac repair and identifies NLRP3 as a new therapeutic target for improving myocardial infarction repair in inflammatory diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214213044

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential of inflammation-related genes in CRC risk prediction. Inflammation gene models were constructed and validated by combining transcriptomic and single-cell data from TCGA and GEO databases, and the expression of inflammation-related genes was verified by RT-qPCR. We identified two molecular subtypes and three genetic subtypes, two risk subgroups according to median risk values, constructed a prognostic model including thirteen genes (TIMP1, GDF15, UCN, KRT4, POU4F1, NXPH1, SIX2, NPC1L1, KLK12, IGFL1, FOXD1, ASPG, and CYP4F8), and validated the performance of each aspect of the model in an external database. Patients in the high-risk group had worse survival with reduced immune cell infiltration and a greater tumor mutational load. The risk score correlated strongly with the immune checkpoints PD1, PDL1, PDL2, and CTLA4, and it is possible that high-risk patients are more sensitive to treatment involving immune checkpoints. In the single-cell data, GDF15 was most significantly expressed in cancer cell populations. Therefore, we further validated their expression in cells and tissues using qPCR.

This study investigates the impact of HA and CS, individually and combined, on ECM degradation in OA and the underlying mechanisms. Methods: OA was modeled in rats through anterior cruciate ligament transection and in cells using IL-1β pretreatment. Treatments included HA and CS, alone or combined, with and without PMA (an NF-κB pathway activator). Cartilage tissue was analyzed using HE and Saffron O-fast green staining, with degradation assessed via the OARSI score. Inflammatory factors were measured by ELISA, and ECM-related proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting. Chondrocyte viability was assessed using CCK8. Results: HA and CS treatments significantly reduced cartilage damage, decreased inflammatory factor release, alleviated ECM degradation, and inhibited NF-κB pathway activation compared to the OA group (P < 0.05). The combination of HA and CS further enhanced these therapeutic effects (P < 0.05). However, these benefits were reversed when PMA was introduced (P < 0.05).

Ferroptosis is increasingly implicated in a host of diseases, and unlike other cell death programs the physiological initiation of ferroptosis is conceived to occur not by an endogenous executioner, but by the withdrawal of cellular guardians that otherwise constantly oppose ferroptosis induction. Here, we profile key ferroptotic defence strategies including iron regulation, phospholipid modulation and enzymes and metabolite systems: glutathione reductase (GR), Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), NAD(P)H Quinone Dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), retinal reductases and retinal dehydrogenases (RDH) and thioredoxin reductases (TR). A common thread uniting all key enzymes and metabolites that combat lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis is a dependence on a key cellular reductant, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). We will outline how cells control central carbon metabolism to produce NADPH and necessary precursors to defend against ferroptosis. Subsequently we will discuss evidence for ferroptosis and NADPH dysregulation in different disease contexts including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, cancer and neurodegeneration. Finally, we discuss several anti-ferroptosis therapeutic strategies spanning the use of radical trapping agents, iron modulation and glutathione dependent redox support and highlight the current landscape of clinical trials focusing on ferroptosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214126421

The regulatory role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in modulating immune responses in SJS/TEN is not fully understood, particularly in relation to chronic SOC. We explored the expression profiles of specific miRNAs and their potential impact on the regulation of key innate immune genes in patients with SJS/TEN with SOC. We analyzed plasma samples from 100 patients with chronic stage SJS/TEN with SOC and 92 healthy controls to examine the expression levels of eight specific miRNAs (let-7a-5p, let-7d-3p, let-7e-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR-151a-3p, miR-151a-5p, miR-27b-3p) using quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). In addition, we subjected mononuclear cells from 12 SJS/TEN patients and 9 controls to RT-qPCR to assess the expression of the innate immune-related genes IFI44L, TNFSF10, AIM2, RSAD2, CXCL10, TRIM22, IFI27, and IFIT2. Significant upregulation of 4 miRNAs (let-7a-5p, let-7e-5p, miR-146a-5p, and miR-27b-3p) was observed in the plasma of SJS/TEN patients; this correlated with the increased expression of TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5. Furthermore, MDA5, IFI44L, RSAD2, CXCL10, and IFIT2 were also significantly up-regulated in the mononuclear cells from these patients, indicating a systemic modulation of immune response genes. Our findings demonstrate that specific miRNAs are up-regulated in SJS/TEN with SOC and associated with the upregulation of critical immune response genes, suggesting their involvement in the pathogenesis and persistence of SOC. These miRNAs and their target genes may serve as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets in managing SJS/TEN with SOC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214125298

Recent Findings: Iron is involved in fundamental biological metabolic processes and is precisely fine-tuned within the body to maintain cellular, tissue and even systemic iron homeostasis. AT not only serves as an energy storage depot but also represents the largest endocrine organ in the human body, maintaining systemic metabolic homeostasis. It is involved in physiological processes such as energy storage, insulin sensitivity regulation and lipid metabolism. As a unique iron-sensing tissue, AT expresses related regulatory factors, including the classic hepcidin, ferroportin (FPN), iron regulatory protein/iron responsive element (IRP/IRE) and ferritin. Consequently, the interaction between AT and iron is intricately intertwined. Imbalance of iron homeostasis produces the potential risks of steatosis, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, leading to AT dysfunction diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Despite the role of AT iron has garnered increasing attention in recent years, a comprehensive review that systematically organizes the connection between iron and AT remains lacking. Summary: Given the necessity of iron homeostasis, emphasizing its potential impact on AT function and metabolism regulation provides valuable insights into physiological effects such as adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis. Futhermore, regulators including adipokines, mitochondria and macrophages have been mentioned, along with analyzing the novel perspective of iron as a key mediator influencing the fat-gut crosstalk. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214124292

Traditional detection techniques such as the Pap smear and colposcopy often lack sensitivity and specificity and are highly dependent on the experience of the gynaecologist. In response, this study proposes the use of Hyperspectral Imaging, a pioneering technology that combines traditional imaging with spectroscopy to provide detailed spatial and spectral information. Over a period of six-months, our custom-designed hyperspectral colposcope was used on 62 patients. The gathered data underwent a specialized preprocessing workflow using a PCA-based strategy for unsupervised segmentation of the cervical region. This process extracted spectral signatures from various tissue types, and our subsequent statistical analysis highlighted its ability to detect differences and alterations in the cervical tissue. This offers a promising avenue for improving the precision of cervical lesion diagnosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214112286

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are components of tumor microenvironment (TME) that influence RCC progression. The impact of RCC-secreted small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) on TME is largely underexplored. Here, we comprehensively analysed the composition of exosomal sncRNAs secreted by RCC cells to identify those that influence MSCs. Methods: Exosomal sncRNAs secreted by RCC cells and normal kidney cells were analyzed using RNAseq, followed by qPCR validation. MSCs were treated by conditioned media (CM) derived from RCC cells and transfected with piRNA, followed by the analysis of proliferation, viability, migration and immunocytochemical detection of piRNA. Expression of MSCs genes was evaluated using microarray and qPCR. TCGA data were analyzed to explore the expression of sncRNAs in RCC tumors. Results: RNAseq revealed 40 miRNAs, 71 tRNAs and four piRNAs that were consistently secreted by RCC cells. qPCR validation using five independent RCC cell lines confirmed that expressions of miR-10b-3p and miR-125a-5p were suppressed, while miR-365b-3p was upregulated in exosomes from RCC cells when compared with normal kidney proximal tubules. The expression of miR-10b-3p and miR-125a-5p was decreased, whereas the expression of miR-365b-3p was increased in RCC tumors and correlated with poor survival of patients. Expressions of tRNA-Glu, tRNA-Gly, and tRNA-Val were the most increased, while tRNA-Gln, tRNA-Leu, and tRNA-Lys were top decreased in RCC exosomes when compared with normal kidney cells. Moreover, hsa_piR_004153, hsa_piR_016735, hsa_piR_019521, and hsa_piR_020365 were consistently upregulated in RCC exosomes. piR_004153 (DQ575660.1; aliases: hsa_piRNA_18299, piR-43772, piR-hsa-5938) was the most highly expressed in exosomes from RCC cells when compared with normal kidney cells. Treatment of MSCs with RCC CM resulted in upregulation of piR_004153 expression. Transfection of MSCs with piR_004153 stimulated their migration and viability, and altered expression of 35 genes, including downregulation of FGF2, SLC7A5, and WISP1. Immunocytochemistry confirmed the nuclear localization of piR_004153 transfected in MSCs. Conclusion: RCC cells secrete multiple sncRNAs, including piR_004153 which targets MSCs, alters expression of FGF2, SLC7A5, and WISP1, and stimulates their motility and viability. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that cancer-derived piRNA can enhance MSC migration. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214106237

We derived a continuous, measured metric, the retinal pigment score (RPS), that quantifies the degree of pigmentation from a colour fundus photograph of the eye. RPS was validated using two large epidemiological studies with demographic and genetic data (UK Biobank and EPIC-Norfolk Study) and reproduced in a Tanzanian, an Australian, and a Chinese dataset. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of RPS from UK Biobank identified 20 loci with known associations with skin, iris and hair pigmentation, of which eight were replicated in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort. There was a strong association between RPS and ethnicity, however, there was substantial overlap between each ethnicity and the respective distributions of RPS scores. RPS decouples traditional demographic variables from clinical imaging characteristics. RPS may serve as a useful metric to quantify the diversity of the training, validation, and testing datasets used in the development of AI algorithms to ensure adequate inclusion and explainability of the model performance, critical in evaluating all currently deployed AI models.

BMSCs from Balb/c mouse were cultured and identified through osteogenesis, adipogenesis, and flow cytometry. After osteogenic induction, the levels of OPN and OCN in BMSCs were detected by RT-qPCR. Alizarin red staining and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining were used to evaluate the osteogenic differentiation ability of BMSCs. PHF20, METTL14, and HOXA13 expressions were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot. After quantitative analysis of m6A level, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) was performed to measure the enrichment of IGF2BP3 or m6A on HOXA13 mRNA. HOXA13 mRNA stability was assessed after actinomycin D treatment. PHF20, METT14, and HOXA13 expressions gradually increased during osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Suppression of PHF20 expression repressed the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, mainly resulted in a decrease in OPN and OCN levels, reduced mineralization, and weakened ALP activity. Mechanistically, PHF20 elevated METTL14 expression by enhancing the enrichment of H3K4me3 on its promoter, and METTL14 strengthened HOXA13 m6A methylation to maintain HOXA13 mRNA stability through IGF2BP3. In conclusion, PHF20 elevates METTL14 expression by enhancing H3K4me3 enrichment on its promoter and enhances HOXA13 mRNA stability via IGF2BP3-mediated m6A modification, thus facilitating HOXA13 expression and eventually inducing osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214102920

Results: The study showed that eight weeks of supplementation with various collagen types had statistically significant effects on pain, quality of life, kinesiophobia, and foot function scale scores in patients with meniscopathy (p < 0.05). Similarly, eight weeks of supplementation showed a statistically significant difference in leg strength (p = 0.057), but no significant difference was found in back strength, proprioception, balance, and various functional test results (p > 0.05). Conclusions: The results of the study showed that the eight-week collagen-based supplement had a positive effect on pain and quality of life levels and some functional test results in patients with meniscopathy. Longer-term studies and diversification of subject groups will help to understand better the effects of the product on meniscal tears and symptoms.

It consists of a semi-structured interview encouraging patients to talk about their lives. The recorded session are transcribed and edited, after which the patient has the opportunity to make further changes to the final document. It can be shared with whom the patient likes. We cross-culturally translated dignity therapy into Dutch and explored its feasibility of applying it to Dutch cognitively capable nursing home residents. Method: Beaton’s Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice were used to cross-culturally translate dignity therapy. Next, a pilot study was conducted with 12 nursing home residents in which the original English-language questionnaire was transculturally translated according to the method of Beaton. After the interviews were completed, feasibility was examined by open-ended questions and a five-point Likert scale questionnaire. Results: We translated the questionnaire. The translated questions were well understood and resulted in an appropriate Dutch version of the English-language dignity therapy questions. However, the words ‘dignity’ and ‘therapy’ caused confusion. The mean number of words in the legacy document was 1078 words, which appeared shorter than in a community-based hospice setting or patients with metastatic cancer or terminally ill people. The reading aloud was much appreciated and was an emotional experience for some. Conclusion: We successfully translated the DTQP into the Dutch language and tested it in 12 nursing home residents.

The development of novel and more effective interventions for PF is an urgent clinical need. A previous study has found that miR-181a-5p plays an important role in the development of PF, and human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) exert potent therapeutic potential on PF. However, whether hAMSCs act on PF by delivering miR-181a-5p and its detailed mechanism still remain unknown. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the underlying possible mechanism of hAMSCs on PF in bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse PF model, and a co-culture system of hAMSCs and A549 cells epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) model, focusing on its effects on collagen deposition, EMT, and epithelial cell cycle regulation. Methods: hAMSCs with different miR-181a-5p expression levels were constructed. BLM (4 mg/kg) was used to create a PF model, while TGF-β1 was used to induce A549 cells to construct an EMT model. Furthermore, the effects of different miR-181a-5p expression in hAMSCs on collagen deposition and EMT during lung fibrosis were assessed in vivo and in vitro. Results: We found that hAMSCs exerted anti-fibrotic effect in BLM-induced mouse PF model. Moreover, hAMSCs also exerted protective effect on TGFβ1-induced A549 cell EMT model. Furthermore, hAMSCs ameliorated PF by promoting epithelial cell proliferation, reducing epithelial cell apoptosis, and attenuating EMT of epithelial cells through paracrine effects. hAMSCs regulated EMT in PF through delivering miR-181a-5p targeting TGFBR1. Conclusions: Our findings reveal for the first time that hAMSCs inhibit PF by promoting epithelial cell proliferation, reducing epithelial cell apoptosis, and attenuating EMT. Mechanistically, the therapeutic effect of hMASCs on PF is achieved through delivering miR-181a-5p targeting TGFBR1. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214087372

These injuries, which frequently call for immediate attention, can affect the hard tissues and supporting components of the teeth, and, because dental damage in deciduous teeth occurs frequently and affects speech, nutrition, and oral development, it is particularly worrying. After searching three databases, Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and PubMed, and removing duplicates, 3,630 articles were screened, and 12 publications were included in the qualitative analysis. Due to their busy lifestyles, children are particularly susceptible to oral trauma and in certain areas and lower socioeconomic groups, the incidence is higher. From little fractures in the enamel to serious dislocations and avulsions, injuries vary and must be treated promptly in order to avoid consequences and to prevent long-term issues. Furthermore, a conservative treatment strategy is recommended to preserve tooth vitality and prevent extractions. Reducing the occurrence of dental injuries requires the implementation of preventive measures including mouthguard use and educational campaigns. In summary, this review emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis, immediate management, and long-term care, by synthesizing existing knowledge on the prevalence, types, management, complications, and prevention of dental trauma in deciduous teeth.

Although engineered EVs demonstrate excellent therapeutic efficacy, challenges such as low production yield and the complexity of engineering modifications constrain their further clinical applications. Bacteria have advantages such as rapid proliferation, diverse gene editing methods, mature cultivation techniques, and relatively easy preparation of bacterial EVs (BEVs), which can be used to effectively address the challenges currently encountered in the field of EVs. This review provides a description of the biogenesis and pathophysiological functions of BEVs, and strategies for optimizing BEVs preparation to attain efficiency and safety are discussed. An analysis of natural characteristics of BEVs is also conducted to explore how to leverage their advantages or mitigate their limitations, thereby overcoming constraints on the application of BEVs in RM.

STAT3 upregulates the transcription of the key epithelial–mesenchymal transition transcription factor SNAIL in a DNA binding-independent manner.

In our study, the lysine methylation binding protein L3MBTL3 is positively associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in female patients with breast cancer. L3MBTL3 also promotes epithelial–mesenchymal transition and metastasis in breast cancer. Mechanistic analysis reveals that L3MBTL3 interacts with STAT3 and recruits STAT3 to the SNAIL promoter to increase SNAIL transcription levels. The interaction between L3MBTL3 and STAT3 is required for SNAIL transcription upregulation and metastasis in breast cancer, while the methylated lysine binding activity of L3MBTL3 is not required for these functions.

IBD-related arthritis is notable for its insidious onset and unpredictability, presenting considerable challenges for clinical diagnosis and management. Factors such as gut microbiota, plasma proteins, inflammatory proteins, and biomarkers found in blood and urine may be closely associated with IBD-related arthritis. However, the mechanisms by which these factors influence this condition remain poorly understood and require urgent investigation. We employed the method of linkage disequilibrium and the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, utilizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies as instrumental variables. In this scientifically rigorous manner, we explored the potential causal relationship between gut microbiota, plasma proteins, inflammatory proteins, and blood and urine biomarkers in relation to arthritis resulting from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This method aids in elucidating the potential roles of these biomarkers in the development of arthritis following IBD, while minimizing the confounding factors and reverse causality commonly encountered in observational studies. To further verify and strengthen our findings, we conducted subsequent sensitivity analyses. These analyses will evaluate the strength of the association between SNPs and the studied biomarkers, as well as post-IBD arthritis, while accounting for variations in SNP distribution among populations and other potential genetic influencing factors. Through these rigorous analytical steps, our objective is to enhance the robustness and credibility of the research findings and provide more reliable scientific evidence regarding the pathogenesis of post-IBD arthritis. MR analysis provides evidence for the association between genetically predicted gut microbiota, plasma proteins, inflammatory proteins, and blood and urine biomarkers with the risk of IBD-related arthritis. This analysis investigates the characteristics of the associations between specific gut microbiota, plasma proteins, inflammatory proteins, and blood and urine biomarkers in relation to IBD-related arthritis. Among the plasma proteins, pterin-4-alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C4, cathepsin L2, angiostatin, hepatocyte growth factor-like protein, hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2, protein O-linked mannose beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2, epididymal-specific alpha-mannosidase, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-like protein are associated with Crohn’s disease-related arthritis. In contrast, agrin, methylenetetrahydrofolate synthetase domain-containing protein, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) growth factor receptor, and neuropilin-1 are associated with ulcerative colitis-related arthritis. Furthermore, regarding gut bacterial pathway abundance, adenosylcobalamin, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylmannosamine, and N-acetylneuraminic acid degradation, as well as glycolysis metabolism and degradation pathways, are associated with Crohn’s disease-related arthritis. Meanwhile, gut bacterial pathway abundance (pentose phosphate pathway) and gut microbiota abundance (Bacteroidetes, Bacteroidia, Bacteroidales, Porphyromonadaceae, Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium eligens) are linked to ulcerative colitis-related arthritis. Notably, we did not identify any connections between inflammatory protein factors, blood and urine biomarkers, and IBD-related arthritis. Lastly, in the reverse MR study, the insufficient number of SNPs available for analysis precluded the detection of a reverse causal relationship.

Recent research has identified ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling-related genes (ACRRGs) as promising targets for therapeutic intervention across various types of cancer. This development offers potential new avenues for addressing the challenges in HCC management. Methods: This study integrated bioinformatics analyses and experimental approaches to explore the role of ACRRGs in HCC. We utilized data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), applying machine learning algorithms to develop a prognostic model based on ACRRGs’ expression. Experimental validation was conducted using quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and functional assays in HCC cell lines and xenograft models. Results: Our bioinformatics analysis identified four key ACRRGs—MORF4L1, HDAC1, VPS72, and RUVBL2—that serve as prognostic markers for HCC. The developed risk prediction model effectively distinguished between high-risk and low-risk patients, showing significant differences in survival outcomes and predicting responses to immunotherapy in HCC patients. Experimentally, MORF4L1 was demonstrated to enhance cancer stemness by activating the Hedgehog signaling pathway, as supported by both in vitro and in vivo assays. Conclusion: ACRRGs, particularly MORF4L1, play crucial roles in modulating HCC progression, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms driving HCC and potential therapeutic targets. Our findings advocate for the inclusion of chromatin remodeling dynamics in the strategic development of precision therapies for HCC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214009858

As a type of noncoding RNA, the microRNA (miRNA) is a vital class of regulatory factor in the epigenetic modifications, while the role of miRNAs in the regulation of epigenetic modifications in ligamentum flavum hypertrophy (LFH) has not been fully investigated. Methods: The miRNA sequencing analysis was used to explore the change of miRNA expression during the fibrosis of ligamentum flavum (LF) cells caused by the TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml). The downregulated miRNA miR-335-3p was selected to investigate its effects on the fibrosis of LF cells and explored the accurate relevant mechanisms. Results: A total of 21 miRNAs were differently expressed during the fibrosis of LF cells. The downregulated miR-335-3p was selected for further investigation. MiR-335-3p was distinctly downregulated in the LFH tissues compared to non-LFH tissues. Overexpression of miR-335-3p could inhibit the fibrosis of LF cells. Further research showed miR-335-3p prevented the fibrosis of LF cells via binding to the 3′-UTR of SERPINE2 to reduce the expression of SERPINE2. The increased SERPINE2 expression might promote the fibrosis of LF cells via the activation of β-catenin signaling pathway to promote the transcription of fibrosis-related genes (ACTA2 and COL3A1). Conclusions: Our results revealed that miR-335-3p prevented the fibrosis of LF cells via the epigenetic regulation of SERPINE2/β-catenin signaling pathway. The epigenetic regulator miR-335-3p might be a promising potential target for the treatment of LFH. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214001366

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 100 patients with meniscus injuries treated with knee arthroscopy from December 2022 to December 2023 and divided them into a control group and a modified group according to the application of “arthroscopic access modification technology”. We compared the operation time, postoperative hospitalization time, VAS score, Lysholm knee function score, postoperative complications, and postoperative images of the patients in these two groups. We compared the operation time, postoperative hospitalization time, pre- and postoperative VAS scores, Lysholm knee function scores, postoperative complications and postoperative imaging indices of the patients in the two groups. Results: All patients successfully underwent surgery and were followed up without intraoperative vascular or nerve injury or postoperative complications such as infection, wound necrosis or thrombosis. The average follow-up time was 16.03 ± 3.69 months; the average operation time and postoperative hospitalization time of the modified group were significantly better than those of the control group were (P < 0.05); the pain and knee function of the two groups significantly improved over time (P < 0.05); and, compared with those of the control group, the modified group could obtain a more satisfactory score at an early stage of the postoperative period (P < 0.05), and the comparison of the intermediate and long-term scores of the two groups was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The improved arthroscopic access technique can make the entry and exit of instruments into and out of the joint cavity smoother, improve the surgical field of view, significantly shorten the operation time, reduce the occurrence of intraoperative complications, improve the function of patients’ knee joints earlier, and increase their satisfaction with the operation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213999327

It is defined as systolic BP (SBP) > 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) > 90 mm Hg. This study aimed to identify determinant risk factors of longitudinal change of SBP and DBP with time to first remission of hypertensive patients. Study Design: A retrospective cohort study. Methods: A descriptive and inferential analysis was employed to explore the determinant risk factors, and a multivariate joint model was applied to test the significant association of the possible risk factors. Results: Of all 369 patients, 235 (63.7%) had first remission with a median survival time of five months. The patients demonstrated shorter first remission time when they had no history of comorbidity, resided in urban areas, took a combination of drugs, and were younger. Similarly, residence, age, treatment, history of diabetes mellitus (DM), history of stroke, and observation time were determinant risk factors of SBP. On the other hand, age, treatment, history of DM, chronic kidney diseases, and observation time were identified as determinant risk factors of DBP. The result revealed a strong positive association between changes in SBP and DBP (P = 0.9923). In addition, a significant association was observed between the value of SBP and time to first remission (γ_1 =-0.0693, HR = 0.993). Conclusion: Having good follow-ups, receiving control of comorbidity, and taking a combination of drugs show several opportunities for decreasing BP. Consequently, this compels patients to experience the first remission early. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213995679

While major strides have been made in generating vaccines and small molecules to combat emerging pathogens, new modalities of treatment are warranted in diseases where there is a lack of treatment options, or where treatment cannot fully eradicate pathogens, as in HIV infection. Cellular therapies, some of which are FDA approved for treating cancer, take advantage of our developing understanding of the immune system, and harness this knowledge to enhance, or direct, immune responses toward infectious agents. As with cancer, viruses that evade immunity, do so by avoiding immune recognition or by redirecting the cellular responses that would eradicate them. As such, infusing virus specific immune cells has the potential to improve patient outcomes and should be investigated as a potential tool in the arsenal to fight infection.

Recently, with the development of next-generation sequencing, a large number of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)-based gene expression profiles about physical activity have been shared in public resources; however, they are poorly curated and underutilized. To tackle this problem, we developed a data atlas of such data through comprehensive data collection, curation, and organization. Methods: The data atlas, termed gene expression profiles of RNA-seq-based exercise responses (GEPREP), was built on a comprehensive collection of high-quality RNA-seq data on exercise responses. The metadata of each sample were manually curated. Data were uniformly processed and batch effects corrected. All the information was well organized in an easy-to-use website for free search, visualization, and download. Results: GEPREP now includes 69 RNA-seq datasets of pre- and post-exercise, comprising 26 human datasets (1120 samples) and 43 mouse datasets (1006 samples). Specifically, there were 977 (87.2 %) human samples of skeletal muscle and 143 (12.8 %) human samples of blood. There were also samples across 9 mice tissues with skeletal muscle (359, 35.7 %) and brain (280, 27.8 %) accounting for the main fractions. Metadata—including subject, exercise interventions, sampling sites, and post-processing methods—are also included. The metadata and gene expression profiles are freely accessible at http://www.geprep.org.cn/. Conclusion: GEPREP is a comprehensive data atlas of RNA-seq-based gene expression profiles responding to exercise. With its reliable annotations and user-friendly interfaces, it has the potential to deepen our understanding of exercise physiology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213979751

In this study, we aimed to construct a cuproptosis-related lncRNAs signature to predict the prognosis and immune landscape of osteosarcoma patients. Databases from TARGET were used to acquire osteosarcoma patient datasets, which included clinical information and RNA sequencing data. Cuproptosis-related lncRNAs was obtained by correlation analysis. Through univariate Cox regression analysis, prognosis-related lncRNAs were obtained. We used nonnegative matrix factorization clustering to identify potential molecular subgroups with different cuproptosis-related lncRNA expression patterns. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to construct the prognostic signature. The ESTIMATE algorithm, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes were applied to explore the underlying mechanisms in the immune landscape of osteosarcoma. We used gene set enrichment analysis to compare the different enrichments in the high-risk group and the low-risk group. Furthermore, we predicted the response to targeted drugs in patients with different risk groups. Using multivariable analysis, we developed a risk scoring model based on 7 long noncoding RNAs and calculated two molecular subgroups from osteosarcoma patients from the database. There is a better immune microenvironment in the low-risk group compared to the high-risk group. At the same time, the gene functional enrichment analysis based on the differently expressed genes obtained by grouping showed they were mainly related to immunity, indicating that cuproptosis-related lncRNAs may affect the prognosis of osteosarcoma by regulating immunity. Moreover, these patients in high-risk group were more susceptible to targeted drugs than the low-risk group. We identified a cuproptosis-related lncRNA prognostic signature for osteosarcoma and showed a close connection in terms of immunity. Moreover, we provided some potential targeted drugs for the treatment of osteosarcoma. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213974193

The presence of the gastritis was associated with significantly lower bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and a significant risk of lower BMD was observed in femoral neck (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 061–0.99). The progression of the gastritis appeared to further increase the risk. In the stage of non-atrophic gastritis, the risk of lower BMD was significantly high, especially in a subgroup with higher gastritis activity in the femoral neck (adjusted OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.42–0.89).

Methods: Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis was performed to assess the causal effects of smoking behavior and DNA methylation levels at smoking-related CpG sites on nine CVDs, including aortic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation, coronary atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart failure, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, subarachnoid hemorrhage. Colocalization analysis was used to further identify key smoking-related CpG sites from the MR causal estimates. Reactome enrichment analysis was used to elucidate the potential mechanisms. Results: MR analysis indicates that smoking behaviors are significantly associated with an increased risk of nine CVDs (OR > 1, P < 0.05). Through MR and colocalization analysis, five key smoking-related CpG sites were ultimately determined. DNA methylation alteration at cg25313468 (located in the TSS1500 region of REST) is simultaneously associated with the risk of atrial fibrillation, coronary atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and myocardial infarction. Additionally, cg21647257 (located in the TSS200 region of CLIP3) is associated with the risk of atrial fibrillation; cg06197751 (located in SGEF gene body) and cg07520810 (located in ARID5B gene body) are associated with the risk of coronary atherosclerosis; cg16822035 (located in MCF2L gene body) is associated with the risk of myocardial infarction. Enrichment analysis suggests that phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) may be involved in the downstream mechanisms of cg25313468 (REST). Conclusion: This study uncovers the relationship between smoking, DNA methylation, and CVDs, providing new insights into the pathogenic effect of smoking on CVDs from an epigenetic perspective. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213964414

We examined the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs), individually or in combination, in a rat model of anterior cruciate ligament-induced degenerative osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. This study seeks to advance clinical approaches to OA treatment. Methods: Eight- to nine-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to two groups: (1) a normal control group (Group A) and (2) a model group. The control group received no treatment. The model group underwent treatment and was further subdivided into six groups: Group B (an injury control group), Group C (high-dose ADSCs), Group D (PRP combined with high-dose ADSCs), Group E (low-dose ADSCs), Group F (PRP combined with low-dose ADSCs), and Group G (PRP alone). PRP and/or ADSCs were administered via intra-articular injection on Days 7, 37, and 67 post-surgery. Daily observations recorded activity levels and behavior, while weight changes were monitored weekly. Digital radiography (DR) was conducted on Days 30, 60, and 90 post-surgery to assess joint surface and contour alterations. Histopathological examination and inflammatory factor analysis were performed on cartilage and synovial tissue. Results: No abnormal reactions were observed in any rats, and body weights increased as expected (P > 0.05). Significant differences in knee swelling rates and Wakitani scores were observed between Groups A and B (P < 0.01). Knee swelling rates also differed significantly between Group B and Groups C–G (P < 0.01). Wakitani scores decreased on Days 60 and 90 in Groups C–G. TNF-α and IL-1β expression levels were significantly higher in Group B compared to Group A (P < 0.05). Expression levels of these genes were significantly lower in Groups C–G than in Group B (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Repeated intra-articular injections of PRP and ADSCs alleviated inflammation and pain, promoted tissue repair, and modulated immune responses in rats with surgically induced OA. The combination of PRP and ADSCs demonstrated enhanced therapeutic efficacy, suggesting its potential as a treatment option for OA. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213962027

Exploring biomarkers that are significantly associated with TME can help guide individualized treatment of patients. Methods: We analyzed the expression and survival of P4HB in pan-cancer through the TCGA database, and verified the protein level of P4HB by the HPA database. In addition, we used the Metascape database to construct protein–protein interaction networks and the single-cell Sequencing database for functional analysis. An immune cell infiltration analysis was performed to explore the potential role of P4HB in TME. We further analyze the relationship between P4HB and immune checkpoint molecules to explore the role of P4HB in immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Finally, the oncogenic role of P4HB in RCC cells was validated using colony formation and wound healing assays. Results: RNA and protein levels of P4HB were extensively up-regulated in pan-cancer. However, high P4HB expression was associated with poor survival in KIRC. The clinical relevance analyses of P4HB suggested that high P4HB expression was associated with advanced clinical TNM stage. Moreover, multivariate cox regression analysis indicated that P4HB (HR = 1.372, 95% CI 1.047–1.681, P = 0.019) was an independent risk factor for OS in KIRC. Functional analysis revealed that P4HB is involved in hypoxia, TME and immune system processes. Our study also found that high P4HB expression was significantly correlated with elevated infiltration levels in CD8 + T cells and M2 macrophages. The results of colony formation and wound healing assays showed that knockdown of P4HB inhibited the RCC growth and migration. Conclusions: P4HB is a specific biomarker for KIRC prognosis and is significantly associated with clinical characteristics. In addition, P4HB may play an influential role in TME and is a biomarker for ICB therapy.

However, the functions and pathophysiological correlates of this tissue are unclear, and its genetic determinants remain unknown. Here, we use deep learning to measure bone marrow adiposity in the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine from MRI scans of approximately 47,000 UK Biobank participants, including over 41,000 white and over 6300 non-white participants. We then establish the heritability and genome-wide significant associations for bone marrow adiposity at each site.

However, the comparative effectiveness of joint-preserving procedures, particularly in the early stages of ONFH (ARCO stage I or II), remains inconclusive. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a novel technique called small-diameter core decompression (CD) combined with platelet-rich plasma (PRP), for the treatment of early-stage ONFH. Methods: Clinical data of 40 patients (51 hips) with pre-collapse stage ONFH were retrospectively analyzed. Nineteen patients (23 hips) underwent small-diameter CD + PRP (group A) and 21 patients (28 hips) received conventional CD (group B) and follow-up was conducted every 3 months. Hip radiographs (X-rays and MRI) were evaluated using various ONFH staging systems (Preserved Angles, ARCO, JIC, and CHFJ stages). X-rays were performed at each follow-up to assess femoral head collapse and the rate of total hip arthroplasty (THA). Additionally, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Harris Hip Score (HHS), Charnley score, SF-36, Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used to evaluate hip pain, function, quality of life, and psychological status. These assessments were conducted both preoperatively and at each follow-up visit. Results: The mean follow-up duration in Group A was 11.57 months, with a femoral head survivorship of 82.61%. One hip underwent THA 14 months after the novel procedure. In Group B, with an average follow-up period of 11.32 months, femoral head survivorship was 60.71% (p = 0.111), and 2 hips required THA (p = 0.999). At the final follow-up, the VAS, stiffness, HHS and Charnley scores of Group A showed significant improvements compared to those in Group B. Quality of life, anxiety and insomnia were also significantly improved in the Group A compared to Group B. Conclusion: The application of PRP following CD results in significant pain relief, improved short-term functional outcomes, and enhanced quality of life compared to CD alone. However, whether it hinders disease progression in early ONFH and reduces the conversion rate to THA and femoral head collapse remains uncertain. Further research with larger sample sizes and extended follow-up is needed to validate these preliminary findings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213885015

However, the roles of LRRK2 during mammalian oocyte maturation are still largely unclear. In present study, we disturbed the activity of LRRK2 and showed its essential roles in porcine oocytes. We showed that LRRK2 stably expressed during oocyte maturation, and the loss of LRRK2 activity disturbed cumulus expansion and oocyte polar body extrusion, indicating its involvement into oocyte maturation. Further analysis indicated that LRRK2 was related with cytoskeleton dynamics since its inhibition caused spindle organization defect and chromosome misalignment, and both cytoplasmic and cortex actin decreased. Moreover, LRRK2 co-localized with mitochondria and its activity was essential for mitochondria distribution. Loss of LRRK2 activity altered the TMRE level, which ultimately induced ROS-related oxidative stress.

At the central of this progression lies podocyte injury, a critical determinant of glomerular dysfunction. Compound K (CK), a bioactive metabolite derived from ginsenoside, has emerged as a compelling candidate for nephroprotective therapy. Here, we unveil the profound therapeutic potential of CK in a folic acid (FA)-induced CKD mouse model, demonstrating its ability to restore renal function and mitigate podocyte injury. CK exerted its nephroprotective effects by reinforcing inter-podocyte junctions, suppressing aberrant podocyte motility, and preventing podocyte detachment and apoptosis, thereby safeguarding the glomerular filtration barrier. Mechanistically, we identified mitochondrial dysregulation as a key driver of excessive oxidative stress, which is commonly associated with podocyte damage. CK remarkably restored mitochondrial homeostasis by attenuating pathological mitochondrial fission and enhancing mitophagy, thereby rebalancing the delicate mitochondrial network. Intriguingly, CK may disrupt the formation of the Drp1-Bax dimer, a crucial mediator of mitochondrial apoptosis, further averting podocyte loss. Collectively, our findings highlight CK as a potent nephroprotective agent, offering a novel therapeutic avenue for CKD management and redefining possibilities in the battle against progressive renal disease. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213827650

Exosomal let-7 g-5p drives M2 polarization by downregulating SOCS7 and relieving its inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation. SERPINE1 promotes the transcription of let-7 g-5p by activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.; Background: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), particularly M2-polarized TAMs, are significant contributors to tumor progression, immune evasion, and therapy resistance in gastric cancer (GC). Despite efforts to target TAM recruitment or depletion, clinical efficacy remains limited. Consequently, the identification of targets that specifically inhibit or reprogram M2-polarized TAMs presents a promising therapeutic strategy. Objective: This study aims to identify a dual-function target in GC cells that drives both malignant phenotypes and M2 macrophage polarization, revealing its molecular mechanisms to provide novel therapeutic targets for selectivly targeting M2-polarized TAMs in GC. Methods: Transcriptomic and clinical data from GC and adjacent tissues were utilized to identify mRNAs associated with high M2 macrophage infiltration and poor prognosis. Single-cell sequencing elucidated cell types expressing the target gene. Transwell co-culture and exosome intervention experiments demonstrated its role in M2 polarization. Small RNA sequencing of exosomes, western blotting, and CoIP assays revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying exosome-mediated M2 polarization. Protein array, ChIP and dual-luciferase reporter assays clarified the molecular mechanisms by which the target gene regulated exosomal miRNA. In vivo validation was performed using xenograft tumor models. Results: SERPINE1 was identified as a highly expressed mRNA in GC tissues and cells, significantly associated with advanced clinical stages, worse prognosis, and higher M2 macrophage infiltration in patients with GC. SERPINE1 overexpression in GC cells promoted tumor growth and M2 macrophage polarization. SERPINE1 facilitated the transfer of let-7 g-5p to macrophages via cancer-derived exosomes, inducing M2 polarization. Exosomal let-7 g-5p internalized by macrophages downregulated SOCS7 protein levels, disrupting its interaction with STAT3 and relieving the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation, thereby leading to STAT3 hyperactivation, which consequently drove M2 polarization. Additionally, in GC cells, elevated SERPINE1 expression activated JAK2, enhancing STAT3 binding to the let-7 g-5p promoter and promoting its transcription, thereby increasing let-7 g-5p levels in exosomes. Conclusion: GC cell-derived SERPINE1, functioning as a primary driver of GC growth and TAM M2 polarization, promotes M2 polarization through the regulation of exosomal let-7 g-5p transfer via autocrine activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. These findings elucidate a novel mechanism of SERPINE1-induced M2 polarization and highlight SERPINE1 as a promising target for advancing immunotherapy and targeted treatments in GC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213806471

DGKα is reportedly associated with progression of tumors, including hepatocellular carcinomas, but its relationship with liver regeneration has not been examined. The purpose of this research is to elucidate the role of DGKα in liver regeneration. Here, we provide a detailed examination of C57BL/6 wild-type and DGKα knockout (KO) mice subjected to 70% partial hepatectomy (70% PH) modeling, including survival rates, hematological marker and gene expression levels, and histological analyses of factors related to liver regeneration. Following 70% PH, DGKα KO mice produce higher levels of hepatobiliary enzymes and have a higher incidence of jaundice compared with wild-type mice, with a death rate of ~ 40%. Furthermore, they exhibit impaired glycogen and lipid consumption, low liver energy charge, and hepatocyte hypertrophy disorder, accompanied by significantly reduced liver expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclin D. We conclude that DGKα is a key molecule in the post-PH liver regeneration process and may have potential as a therapeutic target for the acceleration of liver regeneration. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213797163

In vitro, experiments involved subjecting HaCaT cells to UVB radiation (50 mJ/cm2) for a 24 h incubation period, leading to cell death, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and DNA damaged lesion (8-Oxo Gunosine). ATN treatment effectively mitigated cell toxicity, ROS generation, and 8-Oxo Gunosine in UVB-exposed HaCaT cells. Furthermore, ATN demonstrated its ability to counteract UVB radiation-exposed oxidative stress by inhibiting the activation of phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 (Erk-1), phosphorylated-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-Jnk), and phosphorylated p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (p-p38) in HaCaT cells. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NrF2), recognized for its antioxidant properties, emerged as a key player in protecting against oxidative damage. ATN was observed to inhibit the depletion of NrF2 expression, thereby preventing the depletion of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH) in UVB-exposed HaCaT cells. Additionally, ATN inhibited activator protein-1 (AP-1) and matrix metalloproteinases such as MMP-1 and MMP-9 in UVB-exposed HaCaT cells. In conclusion, our findings highlight that ATN effectively prevents UVB-exposed skin oxidative damage and photoaging by modulating NrF2 expression. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213718748

The original articles published in English that specifically investigate miRNAs linked to male infertility in humans or animals with either type I or ΙΙ diabetes mellitus were included. The relevant articles were gathered from the PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect databases. The quality of study was assessed utilizing the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Prevalence Studies. We collected an overall number of 1989 citations relating to our research subject. Following the elimination of articles based on the criteria, a total of 20 papers were included in the study. Aberrant expression profiles of 25 miRNAs were identified in diabetes associated with male reproductive issues, with 15 miRNAs exhibiting increased expression and 10 miRNAs showing decreased expression. Among the chosen publications, eighteen were identified as low-risk and two were classed as moderate quality. The dysregulated miRNAs were linked to testicular injury, disrupted steroid production, decreased sperm development and quality, and erectile dysfunction. The results demonstrate that the miRNA–mRNA network is linked to the pathological progression of diabetic testicular damage or erectile dysfunction. From a therapeutic perspective, the identification of circulating miRNAs could be beneficial in the timely identification and prevention of diabetes problems, such as diabetes-induced male infertility.

However, they can cause significant functional impairments due to the patella’s role in knee joint extension. Current scoring systems lack objectivity in assessing patellar healing. This study aims to validate the Radiographic Union Score for Tibia (RUST) using biplanar radiographs for assessing surgically treated patellar fractures. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis of radiological follow-up examinations was conducted on patients undergoing surgical treatment for patellar fractures from January 1st 2013, to June 30th 2023. Thirty patients were randomly selected, yielding 105 postoperative X-rays representing various healing stages. The modified Radiographic Union Score for Tibia (RUST) was applied to these X-rays by three independent trauma surgeons. Radiological follow-up examinations were randomized, pseudonymized, and stored on a hospital server for blinded assessment by three raters. The modified RUST assessed continuity of patellar borders and cortexes, assigning scores based on cortical bridging. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), adhering to recommended sample size criteria and interpretation guidelines. Results: The mean modified RUST was 9.1 ± 2.2 points, with scores ranging from 4 to 12 points. The interobserver intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.81–0.92) and the intraobserver ICC were 0.6 (95% CI, 0.65–0.84), 0.80 (95% CI, 0.71–0.87) and 0.98 (0.98–0.99) respectively, which indicated good to excellent agreement. Conclusions: This study validated the Radiographic Union Score for Tibia (RUST) for evaluating bone healing in patellar fractures treated with osteosynthesis, demonstrating good intra- and interobserver reliability. The modified RUST can provide a standardized method for assessing healing in patellar fractures, benefiting both clinical practice and clinical trials. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85213289596

Trimethylamine-n-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite of L-carnitine produced by gut microorganisms and flavin-containing monooxygenase-3, is known to accelerate tissue metabolism and remodeling; however, its role in bone loss remained unexplored. This study investigates the relationship between gut microbiota dysbiosis, TMAO production, and osteoporosis development. We further demonstrate that the loss of beneficial gut microbiota is associated with the development of murine osteoporosis and alterations in the serum metabolome, particularly affecting L-carnitine metabolism. TMAO emerges as a functional metabolite detrimental to bone homeostasis. Notably, transplantation of mouse gut microbiota counteracts obesity- or estrogen deficiency-induced TMAO overproduction and mitigates key features of osteoporosis. Mechanistically, excessive TMAO intake augments bone mass loss by inhibiting bone mineral acquisition and osteogenic differentiation. TMAO activates the PERK and ATF4-dependent disruption of endoplasmic reticulum autophagy and suppresses the folding of ATF5, hindering mitochondrial unfolding protein response (UPRmt) in osteoblasts. Importantly, UPRmt activation by nicotinamide riboside mitigates TMAO-induced inhibition of mineralized matrix biosynthesis by preserving mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and mitophagy. Collectively, our findings revealed that gut microbiota dysbiosis leads to TMAO overproduction, impairing ER homeostasis and UPRmt, thereby aggravating osteoblast dysfunction and development of osteoporosis. Our study elucidates the catabolic role of gut microflora-derived TMAO in bone integrity and highlights the therapeutic potential of healthy donor gut microbiota transplantation to alter the progression of osteoporosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212840070

Prior investigations have demonstrated the potential enhancement of MIRI through EGR1 suppression, although the precise underlying regulatory pathways require further elucidation. The core focus of this investigation is to examine the molecular pathways through EGR1 regulates mitophagy-mediated myocardial cell pyroptosis and its impact on MIRI. Cardiomyocyte hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury models and mouse models of myocardial I/R injury were used to investigate the involvement of EGR1 in regulating mitophagy-mediated myocardial cell pyroptosis in myocardial I/R injury. The research outcomes demonstrated that under H/R conditions, EGR1 expression was upregulated and inhibited the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, leading to enhanced mitophagy and disrupted mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics, ultimately resulting in myocardial cell pyroptosis. Further research revealed that the upregulation of EGR1 expression was mediated by methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3)-mediated m6A modification of EGR1 mRNA and depended on the binding of insulin like growth factor 2 mrna binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) to the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification site to enhance mRNA stability. In vivo animal experiments confirmed that METTL3 upregulated EGR1 expression through IGF2BP2 and suppressed activation of the janus kinase 2 (JAK2) /signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway, thereby inhibiting mitophagy, disrupting mitochondrial dynamics, promoting myocardial cell pyroptosis, and exacerbating I/R injury. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212792050

Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non-Receptor Type 6 (PTPN6), also known as SHP-1, is a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell signaling and has been implicated in various leukemias. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of targeting PTPN6 in AML. We employed both in vitro and in vivo models to evaluate the effects of PTPN6 inhibition on AML cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Our results demonstrate that PTPN6 inhibition leads to a significant reduction in AML cell viability, induces apoptosis, and promotes differentiation of leukemic cells into mature myeloid cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that PTPN6 inhibition disrupts key signaling pathways involved in AML pathogenesis, including the JAK/STAT and PI3K/AKT pathways. Furthermore, the combination of PTPN6 inhibitors with standard chemotherapeutic agents exhibited a synergistic effect, enhancing the overall therapeutic efficacy. These findings suggest that PTPN6 is a promising therapeutic target in AML and warrants further investigation into the development of PTPN6 inhibitors for clinical application in AML treatment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212787837

Recent studies suggest that exosomes enriched with miR-21 (miR-21-Exo) may help mitigate POI, though the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. This research investigates how miR-21-Exo influences chemotherapy-induced POI using an experimental model where KGN cells are exposed to cisplatin. We assessed the impact of miR-21 on cellular activity and generated miR-21 overexpressing bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (miR-21-BMSC) via lentiviral modification. Isolated miR-21-Exo was analyzed for its effects on cellular function. Bioinformatics identified Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation Protein 1 (MALT1) as a target of miR-21. We confirmed that miR-21-Exo regulates MALT1 and the NF-κB signaling pathway to prevent cell pyroptosis. Further studies in a rat model demonstrated the therapeutic potential and safety of miR-21-Exo. Overall, our findings highlight a novel strategy for addressing chemotherapy-induced POI by modulating MALT1 and the NF-κB pathway, offering significant therapeutic implications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212762154

Thus, numerous findings suggest that targeting epigenetic factors might be a focus for anti-cancer treatment. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that telomerase activator might be a potential epigenetic regulator in combatting skin cancer cell proliferation. Methods: Melanoma cell line A375 cells were treated with telomerase activator TA-65. Cell senescence assay was done to evaluate the senescence induction. Morphological changes and differences in expression of HDACs and hTERT genes were studied. Further, hyaluronidase and anti-oxidant assays were also performed. Additionally, telomerase enzyme and 20S proteasome activity was also studied. Results: Morphological changes were observed in treated cells and it is evident that telomerase activator induced cellular senescence in high concentrations. From our results, it is evident that HDAC8 and HDAC10 expression was upregulated, whereas hTERT gene expression was downregulated in treated groups. This suggests that the telomerase activator has a regulatory role in skin cancer cells proliferation by targeting the epigenetic factors. Conclusion: Targeting HDACs and hTERT in the treatment of melanoma is a prominent concern. In our current study, we highlight the most recent research, although in its initial stage, involving various epigenetic factors involved in melanoma cells proliferation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212695317

Although there is diversity in their specific mechanisms, microRNAs (miRNAs) have a significant impact on the development of asthma. Currently, the contribution of miR-130b-3p to asthma remains elusive. The goal of this study was to examine whether miR-130b-3p attenuates house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthma through High-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1)/Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/mitochondrial fission protein (DRP1) signaling pathway. We elucidate that miR-130b-3p can bind to the HMGB1 3'UTR, attenuating HMGB1 mRNA and protein levels, and nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation of HMGB1. We observed that miR-130b-3p agomir or HMGB1 CKO attenuated HDM-induced airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, and decreased Th2-type cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and mediastinal lymph nodes. Further, HMGB1 CKO contributes to alleviating Th2 inflammation in AT-II cells (CD45.2−/CD31−/Epcam−+/proSP-C+/MHC-II+) from lung single cell suspensions of asthmatic mice by flow cytometry. Our findings identified miR-130b-3p as a potent regulator in asthma that exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by targeting HMGB1 and the subsequent HMGB1/TLR4/DRP1axis, presenting a prospective novel therapeutic avenue for asthma management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212677002

Based on the network pharmacological analysis, XHDCT chemical constituents and targets of each chemical constituent were screened through the TCMSP database, and differential-expressed genes of bronchial asthma were obtained from the GEO database, which were intersected to get XHDCT potential anti-inflammatory targets. The key anti-inflammatory targets of XHDCT were acquired by protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis of the candidate targets. Bronchial asthma mouse models were established and the pathological changes of lung tissues were observed. Serum IgE levels were tested. Total cells and eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were counted. The expression of Th2-associated cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13) and chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and eotaxin) in BALF were measured. The targeting relationship between miR-107-3p and PTGS2 was tested. XHDCT delayed bronchial asthma inflammation in in-vivo asthma mouse models. A total of 155 active ingredients and their 341 targets were intersected with bronchial asthma-relevant genes, obtaining 20 potential targets of XHDCT for bronchial asthma treatment. Based on the PPI and “drug-component-target” network diagram, PTGS2 was found to be in a central position. PTGS2 was downregulated and miR-107-3p was upregulated in bronchial asthma mice after XHDCT treatment. PTGS2 overexpression activated the MAPK signaling pathway to promote inflammation in bronchial asthma mice, whereas inflammatory symptoms were reduced and the MAPK signaling pathway was inhibited after XHDCT treatment. miR-107-3p was an upstream regulatory miRNA for PTGS2. After miR-107-3p interference, the activation of the PTGS2/MAPK axis promoted inflammation in bronchial asthma mice, whereas the inflammatory symptoms were reduced after XHDCT treatment.

The current study aimed to examine the proliferative effects of exosomes derived from the HL-60 cell line, a representative of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), on the cell cycle progression of human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSCs), a key element of the BMM. Methods and results: hBM-MSCs were treated with different concentrations of AML-derived exosomes from the HL-60 cell line. The results were obtained from MTT, cell proliferation, cell cycle, and RT-qPCR evaluations. In the current study, we found that the proliferation effects of AML-derived exosomes relied on the dose and the time, and the optimal effects of exosomes were seen in 50 μg/ml, 48 h treatment. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a significant increase in the G1 phase, showing a 1.6-fold change compared to the control group (p value < 0.0001). RT-qPCR results demonstrated a significant upregulation of CCND1 (3.3-fold, p value < 0.0001), CDK4 (3.7-fold, p value < 0.0001), CDK6 (3.3-fold, p value < 0.0001), RAS (3.2-fold, p value < 0.0001), and Erk (3.4-fold, p value < 0.0001) expression levels, along with increased Ki-67 (2.6-fold, p value < 0.0001) levels. Moreover, treatment with 50 μg/ml, 48 h of AML-derived exosomes resulted in a notable reduction in BM-MSC apoptosis both in early (p value < 0.0001) and late (p value < 0.0001) apoptosis rate compared to control group. Conclusions: The findings will be of interest to AML-derived exosomes, which were able to potentiate the activation of the signaling pathways involved in the survival and proliferation of hBM-MSCs. Our findings suggest their specific targeting as a potential therapeutic strategy against cancer progression and metastasis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212483709

The outcomes of interest were the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Western Ontario McMaster Osteo-Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores. Methods: This study was conducted according to the 2020 PRISMA statement. In April 2024, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Embase were accessed without time constraints. All the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of intra-articular HA injections in the early stages of knee OA were accessed. Data concerning the VAS, WOMAC, and related subscales were collected at baseline and the last follow-up. Only studies clearly stated the degrees of advancement of OA using the Kellgren-Lawrence scoring system were used. Results: The literature search resulted in four RCTs (390 patients). The mean length of the last follow-up was 7.5 ± 3.0 months. 72.3% (282 of 390) of the patients were women. The mean age of the patients was 58.1 ± 3.2 years, and the mean BMI was 27.3 ± 3.2 kg/m2. At the last follow-up, no difference was found between HA and the control group in VAS, WOMAC, and related subscales. Conclusion: In patients with early to mild knee osteoarthritis, the current level of evidence suggests that intra-articular injections using HA performed similarly to other biologically active compounds commonly injected in the knee joint for a minimum of three months.

IGF2BP2, an m6A modification regulator, is upregulated in lung cancer tissue, but its specific role within the LUAD tumor microenvironment (TME) is unknown. We explored the role of IGF2BP2 in the progression of LUAD. IGF2BP2 expression in LUAD patient specimens and controls was evaluated through bioinformatics, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. LUAD subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft tumor models were established, alongside a co-culture system of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and A549 cells. Functional assays assessed IGF2BP2’s role under treatment with JX5, an IGF2BP2 inhibitor. Mechanistic assays explored the interaction between IGF2BP2 and LOX1 in 293T cells. IGF2BP2 was significantly upregulated in LUAD tissues, with higher expression levels predicting worse prognosis for patients (p < 0.001). In subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft models, treatment with JX5, an IGF2BP2 inhibitor, reduced tumor size, volume, and weight (p < 0.001). JX5 also significantly reduced the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001). Flow cytometry analysis indicated JX5 reduced CD11b+Ly6G+/CD45+ cells (TANs) in the TME (p < 0.001). Mechanistically, JX5 downregulated LOX1 expression in vivo, and co-culture experiments further demonstrated that IGF2BP2 promotes LUAD progression through LOX1-mediated regulation of TAN activity (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001). Overexpression of LOX1 reversed the inhibitory effects of JX5 on TAN infiltration, tumor cell viability, and apoptosis (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001). Additionally, RNA immunoprecipitation revealed that IGF2BP2 binds to LOX1 mRNA at its m6A modification site, stabilizing LOX1 and enhancing its function in the TME. Knockdown of IGF2BP2 accelerated LOX1 mRNA degradation, confirming its role in maintaining LOX1 stability (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001). IGF2BP2 recognizes and stabilizes LOX1 through m6A modification, contributing to TAN-mediated LUAD progression. Overall, these findings offer new insights into LUAD progression and demonstrate that IGF2BP2 is a key regulator that promotes tumor advancement, highlighting the IGF2BP2-LOX1 axis as a potential therapeutic target for LUAD. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212260192

Circular-stapled anastomosis is considered the “gold standard” method for oesophagojejunostomy in open total gastrectomy. A purse-string suture instrument is used to create a purse-string suture along the distal oesophagus as a standard technique for classic circular-stapled oesophagojejunostomy in the open total gastrectomy. However, a simple and optimal laparoscopic purse-string suture device or instrument with an appropriate and optimal tube in the abdomen remains to be developed as a standard procedure for simple intracorporeal oesophagojejunostomy. Study design: Between May 2023 and October 2023, a new laparoscopic purse-string suture clamp (Lap-PSC) and multi-functional seal cap (MSC) were applied to obtain a simple intracorporeal circular-stapled oesophagojejunostomy after laparoscopic total gastrectomy in 21 patients with gastric cancer in our hospital. The surgical details and postoperative outcomes were analyzed to evaluate this method. Results: The mean operation time was 203.8 ± 39.1 min. The mean time for the purse-string suture was 6.6 ± 2.8 min. An average of 13 min was required for purse-string creation and anvil placement. Tumor-free margins were obtained in 21 patients, with a median proximal margin length of 2 cm (range, 1.5–5 cm). Four postoperative complications occurred in this study. There was no mortality. During the median follow-up periods of 11 months, no anastomosis-related complications were observed. Conclusions: The standardized single-stapling end-to-side oesophagojejunostomy in open surgery can be easily and safely performed during LTG using both Lap-PSC and MSC. The procedure using Lap-PSC with MSC may be considered as a better procedure to option in LTG. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212218440

CVI is a common vascular disorder characterised by impaired blood flow in the veins, often leading to various clinical manifestations. To better understand the additional underlying mechanisms of CVI, it is essential to explore the role of Wnt proteins, which play a crucial role in regulating signalling processes. This study aimed to investigate the expression levels of the Wnt3a and Wnt5a genes using real-time PCR in patients with venous insufficiency compared to acontrol group. Methods and results: 68 participants were included, comprising 29 controls and 39 patients with venous insufficiency from Near East University Hospital. Real-time PCR was utilised for gene expression analysis on a segment of the great saphenous vein biopsy, encompassing all vascular layers, from each participant in both groups. With a significance threshold of p < 0.05, the analysis revealed a significant difference in Wnt3a gene expression (p ₌ 0.0007) and a nonsignificant difference in Wnt5a expression levels (p ₌ 0.5726) between patients with venous insufficiency and the healthy control group. Conclusion: This study indicates fluctuations in the Wnt genes in varicose vein biopsies compared to healthy veins. Consequently, further research is essential to elucidate whether the dysregulation of the Wnt pathway induces venous insufficiency or vice versa. This may facilitate targeted interventions addressing its fundamental molecular aberrations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85212037437

This study used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to reveal gene expression changes during ADSCs to neuronal differentiation. Sequencing of the ADSCs group, the prei-1d group, and the induction 1 h, 3 h, 5 h, 6 h, and 8 h groups was performed using the BD Rhapsody platform. Sequence data were analyzed using t-SNE, Monocle2, GO, and KEGG algorithms. Results showed that a total of 38,453 cells were collected, which were divided into 0–13 clusters. Monocle2 structured analysis revealed that ADSCs were located at the beginning of the trajectory, and the cells after 5 h of induction were mainly distributed at the end of the trajectory in branches 1 and 2. Up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 5 h after induction enriched GO items including cellular protein metabolism, cell adhesion, endocytosis, and cell migration. KEGG analysis showed that induced 6 h and 8 h groups mainly enriched pathways were oxidative phosphorylation, glutathione metabolism, and expression of Parkinson's disease-related genes. In conclusion, two distinct cell state mechanisms stimulate ADSCs to develop into mature neurons. ADSCs induced for 5 h had developed into mature neurons.

Persistent proatlantal intersegmental artery (PPIA) is an example of a rare persistent carotid-basilar anastomosis that deserves to be featured through this imaging technic. Purpose: The aim of this study is to explore the imaging characteristics of the PPIA using MSCTA and to assess its clinical significance. Furthermore, the study seeks to propose a novel classification system predicated on the posterior circulation blood supply. Materials and methods: This retrospective analysis evaluated the imaging and clinical data of 11 patients diagnosed with a PPIA using MSCTA. Results: The incidence of the PPIA was found to be 0.01%. Classification based on the origin of the PPIA identified two cases (18.2%) as type I and nine cases (81.8%) as type II. This study introduced a novel classification system for PPIA, which is based on the posterior circulation blood supply, encompassing the persistent artery, vertebral artery, and posterior communicating artery. Among the 11 patients with PPIA, there were 11 instances of ipsilateral vertebral artery agenesis, three cases of contralateral vertebral artery hypoplasia, one case of contralateral vertebral artery agenesis, two cases of persistent artery hypoplasia, and two cases of basilar artery hypoplasia. Furthermore, the study identified two patients with aneurysms, one with cerebral infarction, and one with a Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula. Conclusion: The proposed classification system for PPIA enhances the understanding of posterior circulation blood supply, which is vital for pre-interventional and pre-surgical imaging assessments. In PPIA cases, the ipsilateral vertebral artery is consistently hypoplastic, and the PPIA predominantly serves the posterior fossa’s vascularization in about 75% of cases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211224869

Methods: To determine whether Forkhead boxO1 (FoxO1) is implicated in the development of HSCs, lentiviral vectors expressing knockdown (KD) or overexpression (OE) of FoxO1 were utilized in fetal liver-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (FL-HSPCs). The impacts on the proliferation and hematopoietic differentiation of FL-HSPCs were subsequently evaluated via flow cytometry (FCM). Furthermore, the effect of FoxO1-OE on the self-renewal of cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (CB-HSPCs) was investigated. Additionally, the transplantation ability of hematopoietic stem cells derived from these CB-HSPCs in mice after secondary transplantation was also assessed by FCM. Result: After knocking down FoxO1 in FL-HSPCs, the apoptosis rate was significantly increased, and the expression of hCD45 was significantly decreased. Conversely, overexpression of FoxO1 reversed this phenomenon, effectively promoting the expansion and differentiation of FL-HSPCs in vitro. Similarly, it was found that FoxO1-OE could effectively enhance the expansion of CB-HSPCs. Furthermore, upon transplantation of CB-HSPCs overexpressing FoxO1 into NSG mice, multilineage human hematopoietic reconstruction was promoted. Notably, the results of secondary transplantation revealed that only the FoxO1-OE group exhibited multilineage reconstitution. Conclusion: In conclusion, our study confirmed that FoxO1-OE could enhance the self-renewal and engraftment of CB-HSPCs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211185009

Recent Findings: Indicate that osteoporosis is a global public health problem that impacts individuals and society. In postmenopausal women, a decrease in estrogen levels is associated with a decrease in gut microbial diversity and richness, as well as increased permeability of the gut barrier, which allows for low-grade inflammation. The direct effects of estrogen status on the association between bone and the gut microbiome were observed in untreated and treated ovariectomized women. In addition to the direct effects of estrogens on bone remodeling, estrogen therapy could reduce the risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis by preventing increased gut epithelial permeability, bacterial translocation and inflammaging. However, in studies comparing the gut microbiota of older women, there were no changes at the phylum level, suggesting that age-related comorbidities may have a greater impact on changes in the gut microbiota than menopausal status does. Summary: Estrogens modify bone health not only by directly influencing bone remodeling, but also indirectly by influencing the gut microbiota, gut barrier function and the resulting changes in immune system reactivity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210091215

Furthermore, several studies have highlighted the prognostic and diagnostic value of this miRNA, which could be valuable for the diagnosis and treatment of certain disorders. We present an overview of the latest findings regarding miR-7-5p’s role in the development of cancer, its action mechanisms, and expression, based on in vivo, in vitro, and human research. Additionally, we discuss the function of miR-7-5p as a prognostic biomarker in cancer and explore its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210085526

The present meta-analysis compared intra-articular injections of HA versus ozone in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). The outcomes of interest were to determine if intra-articular ozone injections show comparable visual analogue scale (VAS) and Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores compared to intra-articular HA injections. Methods: This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses: the 2020 PRISMA statement. In January 2024, the following databases were accessed: PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Embase. All the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intra-articular HA versus ozone injections in patients with knee OA were accessed. Only studies which clearly stated that injections were performed in patients with knee OA were considered. Data concerning the VAS and WOMAC were retrieved at baseline and the last follow-up. Studies with a follow-up shorter than 4 months or longer than 6 months were not included. Results: Data from 424 patients were collected. 74% (314 of 424 patients) were women. The mean age of the patients was 61.1 ± 4.5 years, and the mean BMI was 27.8 ± 0.8 kg/m2. Compatibility was found in the mean age, mean BMI, PROMs, and the percentage of women. No difference was found in VAS at follow-up (P = 0.4). Conclusion: The current level I evidence suggests that ozone and HA intra-articular injections achieve similar pain control between 4 and 6 months of follow-up.

The effect of hypoxia is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1A (HIF-1A) via targeting various downstream pathways, including glycolysis, angiogenesis, and survival signaling. However, HCC cell lines in a 2-dimensional (2D) setting do not resemble the metabolic signature of HCC. Here we aim to overcome these limitations by developing an HCC organoid that recapitulates the HIF-1A metabolic shift. The enrichment analysis of the RNA-Seq data revealed that HIF-1A-driven glycolytic shift is of the significant pathways. The established organoid model, using xeno-free plasma-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) as a scaffold and nutritive biomatrix, maintained its structural integrity and viability for up to 14 days; the comparative analysis of the cobalt (II) chloride (CoCl<inf>2</inf>)-treated organoids to the untreated ones unveiled reduced size and proliferative capacity. Interestingly, our organoid model showed an elevated expression of HIF-1A and glycolysis enzymes compared to their counterparts in the CoCl<inf>2</inf>-treated organoids. HIF-1A molecular expression-translated biochemical signature is further assessed in our spontaneously growing organoids showing an increase in glucose uptake, intracellular pyruvate, extracellular lactate dehydrogenase expression, and extracellular lactate production, while hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>), a marker for oxidative metabolism, is reduced. Our data confirmed the potency of the established organoid model to mimic the molecular and biochemical HIF-1A-driven metabolism, which validates its potential use as an in vitro HCC model. Our model naturally simulates hypoxic conditions and simultaneous HIF-1A-dependent glycolysis within HCC rather than using of CoCl<inf>2</inf>-induced hypoxic conditions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85209762000

Methods: This study was retrospective case series of mandibular bone defect reconstruction using CO<inf>3</inf>Ap granules. Six patients with jawbone cysts treated by simultaneous grafting CO<inf>3</inf>Ap granules after cyst enucleation were enrolled. Patients without grafting CO<inf>3</inf>Ap granules were excluded. Mandibular bone height including buccolingual bone height, the change of perpendicular distance between the buccolingual line to the alveolar ridge, and the three-dimensional volume of remaining CO<inf>3</inf>Ap granules were analyzed using CT images obtained at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively.

Increasing studies suggest BMP2 is involved in several respiratory diseases. This study aimed to review the role and mechanisms of BMP2 in respiratory diseases. Recent findings: BMP2 signaling pathway includes the canonical and non-canonical signaling pathway. The canonical signaling pathway is the BMP2-SMAD pathway, and the non-canonical signaling pathway includes mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway. The BMP2 is related to pulmonary hypertension (PH), lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis (PF), asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). BMP2 inhibits the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), promotes the apoptosis of PASMCs to reduce pulmonary vascular remodeling in PH, which is closely related to the canonical and non-canonical pathway. In addition, BMP2 stimulates the proliferation and migration of cells to promote the occurrence, colonization, and metastasis of lung cancer through the canonical and the non-canonical pathway. Meanwhile, BMP2 exert anti-fibrotic function in PF through canonical signaling pathway. Moreover, BMP2 inhibits airway inflammation to maintain airway homeostasis in asthma. However, the signaling pathways involved in asthma are poorly understood. BMP2 inhibits the expression of ciliary protein and promotes squamous metaplasia of airway epithelial cells to accelerate the development of COPD.

In this study, we developed a bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)/sulfated chitosan (SCS)/calcium phosphate cement (CPC) composite scaffold to enhance spinal fusion in aged mice. BMP-2/SCS significantly improved spinal fusion success rates (83.3 %) compared to BMP-2 alone (16.7 %) and high-dose BMP-2 (50 %). The BMP-2/SCS group promoted robust new bone formation and H-type vessel development, facilitating vascular-bone coupling in the fusion region. Mechanistically, SCS suppressed BMP-2-induced osteoclast overactivation and reduced MMP-9 secretion, leading to vertebral skeletal stem cell (vSSC) rejuvenation. Rejuvenated vSSCs primarily differentiated into the osteogenic bone/cartilage lineage while stromal lineage differentiation was suppressed. In contrast, co-administration of BMP-2 and alendronate sodium abolished BMP-2-mediated increases in vSSC numbers, vSSC rejuvenation, and bone integration, highlighting the indispensable role of osteoclast activity in BMP-2-induced bone regeneration. Collectively, this study demonstrates that BMP-2/SCS scaffolds effectively reverse age-related deficiencies by creating a rejuvenated bone microenvironment, promoting vascular-bone coupling, and enhancing osteogenesis, offering a promising strategy to improve spinal fusion outcomes in elderly patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015336956

Both severe TBIs and repeated mild TBIs (rmTBIs) can lead to persistent symptoms such as cognitive deficits, and even neurodegenerative diseases like chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). To date, no therapies exist to mitigate the risk of CTE or other chronic symptoms post-TBI. Tau protein accumulation plays a pivotal role in the development of CTE. Recent studies indicate that small-molecular ligands targeting prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) can decrease Tau accumulation through the activation of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A). This led us to investigate whether PREP ligands could alleviate behavioural deficits in an rmTBI mouse model. In our study, mice subjected to five closed-head impacts at 24-h intervals were treated after each hit with either a typical PREP inhibitor, KYP-2047, or a novel PREP ligand, HUP-46. PREP knock-out mice also underwent similar impacts. Results demonstrated significant cognitive deficits in rmTBI mice as measured by the Barnes Maze at a 3-month endpoint. However, HUP-46 successfully mitigated these cognitive deficits, and PREP knock-out mice showed resistance to rmTBI-induced cognitive impairments. HUP-46 notably reduced rmTBI-induced astrogliosis and the levels of p21, a cell-cycle inhibitor and a cellular senescence marker connected with aging-related diseases, in the cortex. Additionally, PREP ligands diminished the phosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII) shortly after rmTBI. While Tau accumulation was observed only in the dorsal fornix—an essential white matter tract for hippocampal connectivity—PREP ligands did not significantly affect this accumulation. Collectively, these findings suggest that PREP ligands could serve as a therapeutic intervention post-TBI to lower long-term risks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015335039

However, the asphalt modified with SBS suffers from inherent storage instability, which is chiefly ascribed to thermodynamic incompatibility between SBS and asphalt. This study introduces a novel grafted terpolymer synthesized through melt grafting, involving glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and styrene (St) co-monomers SBS-g-(GMA-co-St). Successful grafting was attested by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, whilst chemical titration revealed maximum grafting efficiency at an optimal St/GMA mass ratio of 0.5. According to microstructural analysis via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), interfacial adhesion was intensified through polarity modification of SBS, and compared to conventional SBS, accelerated phase separation testing demonstrated 32 % and 61 % declines in segregation rate for GMA and GMA-co-St-grafted modifiers, respectively. As shown by rheological characterization through temperature scanning and MSCR testing, the grafted SBS performs exceptionally in retaining elasticity and suppressing viscosity. The PG grading of the grafted SBS is higher than that of the original SBS, and the creep recovery rate is elevated by 23.1 %. Finally, a fluorescence microscope was leveraged to observe the dispersion of the modifier and asphalt after segregation. A clear contact surface was found between the SBS and the asphalt before grafting modification, with pronounced agglomeration phenomena, while it was the opposite situation for the SBS after grafting modification. These findings microscopically corroborate the effectiveness of grafting modification in underpinning asphalt storage stability, which unlock new avenues for solving the segregation problem of SBS modified asphalt. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015303428

Hypoxia-inducible factor 3α (HIF3α), a transcription factor involved in apoptosis, plays a crucial role in multiple cognitive disorders. However, the role of HIF3α in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion remains unclear. In this study, we employed an in vitro model of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and a hemorrhagic shock and reperfusion (HSR) model to simulate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Both models demonstrated high co-localization of SIRT1 and HIF3α in hippocampal neurons, as well as increased expression of phosphorylated tau protein and neuronal apoptosis. siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF3α downregulated SIRT1 protein expression in hippocampal neurons subjected to OGD/R, whereas pharmacological inhibition or gene knockdown of SIRT1 did not alter HIF3α levels. HIF3α knockdown also enhanced the antioxidant response, and attenuated OGD/R-induced autophagy, phosphorylated tau protein expression and neuronal apoptosis in vitro. Notably, OGD/R promoted autophagy in hippocampal neurons, while autophagy inhibition by 3-MA decreased phosphorylated tau expression and neuronal apoptosis after OGD/R. Consistent with the results of the in vitro experiments, HIF3α knockout reduced SIRT1 and LC3B protein levels, decreased phosphorylated tau expression and improved hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and synaptic loss, thereby ameliorating cognitive deficits following HSR. Collectively, our findings reveal that HIF3α exacerbates CIRI-related cognitive impairment by promoting SIRT1-dependent autophagy, resulting in hippocampal neuronal apoptosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015162092

Moreover, the complex inflammatory microenvironment in bone defects often impairs healing outcomes, necessitating the development of advanced biomaterials with enhanced immunomodulatory and regenerative capabilities. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of extracellular vesicles derived from Astragalus-modified calcium silicate (AstCS)-stimulated M2 macrophages (AstCSM2EVs) in bone regeneration. The AstCSM2EVs demonstrated superior immunomodulatory capabilities by effectively polarizing macrophages toward the M2 phenotype, characterized by significant downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α) and concurrent upregulation of anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-4, IL-10). Notably, AstCSM2EVs exhibited enhanced angiogenic potential, evidenced by increased endothelial tube formation and elevated VEGF secretion, while simultaneously promoting osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells through upregulated expression of key markers including ALP, BSP, and OC. Mechanistic investigations revealed that AstCSM2EVs modulated these regenerative processes primarily through miR-218-5p-mediated regulation of multiple signaling pathways, including NOD-like receptor and ECM-receptor interaction pathways. In a rabbit femoral defect model, local administration of AstCSM2EVs significantly enhanced bone regeneration, demonstrated by increased bone volume fraction and improved trabecular architecture, while effectively suppressing local inflammation. These findings establish AstCSM2EVs as a promising therapeutic agent for bone regeneration, highlighting their multifaceted roles in immunomodulation, angiogenesis, and osteogenesis. This research introduces an innovative approach that combines extracellular vesicles (EV) with immunomodulatory tissue engineering strategies to improve the treatment of bone defects. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015150870

Without timely intervention, these wounds can progress to severe complications including cellulitis, chronic infections, and osteomyelitis. In this study, we developed a chitosan/sodium β-glycerophosphate/gelatin (CS/β-GP/GEL) thermosensitive hydrogel system to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) in pressure ulcer healing. The incorporation of gelatin addresses the limitations of conventional CS/β-GP hydrogels, such as low mechanical strength and poor biocompatibility. The optimized CS/β-GP/GEL hydrogel exhibits good injectability, suitable gel formation time and pH, facilitating efficient ADSCs encapsulation. Furthermore, the hydrogel demonstrates good water absorption capacity, degradability, and rheological properties, making it suitable for biomedical applications. In vitro studies confirmed the hydrogel's high cytocompatibility, supporting ADSCs viability and proliferation. Additionally, the CS/β-GP/GEL@ADSC composite demonstrated pro-angiogenic properties, suppressed reactive oxygen species-mediated apoptosis, and facilitated the accumulation of M2-type macrophages. In vivo evaluations revealed that the CS/β-GP/GEL@ADSC composite had high histocompatibility and accelerated pressure ulcer healing in a rat model, mediated through enhanced angiogenesis, M2-dominant macrophage polarization, and improved extracellular matrix remodeling. These findings highlight the potential of CS/β-GP/GEL@ADSC as a promising therapeutic strategy for pressure ulcer management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015149320

Statins, beyond their lipid-lowering role, exert pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, including IL-6 suppression, NF-κB inhibition, immune cell modulation, and potential alteration of exosome secretion. Methods: Building upon this background, this narrative review synthesises preclinical and clinical evidence on pre-donation statin therapy in solid organ transplantation. Specifically, we examine mechanistic pathways, such as cytokine signalling, vascular protection, and exosome modulation, alongside clinical data from heart, liver, lung, and kidney transplantation. Results: In terms of outcomes, preclinical models consistently demonstrate reduced inflammatory burden, preserved microvascular integrity, and improved graft function with donor statin therapy. Moving to clinical studies, limited randomised controlled trials suggest early biochemical and haemodynamic benefits, such as reduced cardiac biomarkers, lower ALT in liver recipients, and reduced primary graft dysfunction in lung recipients. However, evidence for improved long-term graft survival, rejection rates, or mortality is inconsistent. Most trials are underpowered, single-centre, and lack mechanistic endpoint analysis, and data on donation after circulatory death and living donors remain sparse. Conclusions: Pre-donation statin therapy is biologically plausible, safe in early studies, and supported by robust mechanistic rationale, yet definitive clinical benefit remains unproven. Large, multi-centre trials incorporating mechanistic and clinical endpoints, such as the ongoing SIGNET study, are essential to determine whether this strategy should be integrated into standard donor management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015139967

These problems can lead to both environmental and economic impacts. An innovative method that combines physical and chemical separation techniques (PCST) is proposed to improve the recycling rate of RAP aggregates and enhance the performance of reclaimed asphalt mixtures (RAM). In this method, RAP is first classified by particle size using a vibrating screen. The aggregates and asphalt are then separated and recycled through a combination of physical and chemical processes. The recovered materials are used to produce new RAM. The results show that the maximum separation efficiency reaches 83.12 % for coarse aggregates and 88.52 % for fine aggregates. The combined separation method significantly reduces RAP agglomeration and variability, improving the adhesion between aggregates and asphalt. RAM produced with the separated aggregates demonstrates a 13.35 % improvement in low-temperature stability, a 1.28 % increase in residual stability, and a 5.39 % enhancement in freeze-thaw splitting strength compared to the refined separation method (RCS). These findings provide a new approach for the efficient recycling of RAP materials and support the development of more sustainable and cost-effective road construction practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015139519

Activating M2 anti-inflammatory polarization, which remove excess extracellular matrix (ECM) via phagocytosis, represents a potential therapeutic target for RA. This study introduces Col/Cs@ECM microspheres, a novel drug delivery system designed for macrophage recognition via a tailored ECM surface, enhancing phagocytic efficiency and accumulation. Moreover, the Col/Cs@ECM microspheres are composed of biocompatible and fully degradable materials, ensuring their safety profile within the physiological environment. Following cell phagocytosis, the collagen/chitosan (Col/Cs) core release the drug (Dexamethasone, Dex) intracellularly to inhibit M1 polarization by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway and to facilitate M2 polarization. This macrophage targeted and intracellular release approach offers a significant advantage over traditional medications by reducing systemic side effects and improving the therapeutic index. The strategy prompts macrophages to express anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 while suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, thereby remodeling the immune microenvironment. Additionally, the specially engineered ECM shell of the microspheres extends the anti-inflammatory response by prolonging macrophage lifespan, a feature that is not present in conventional treatments. This results in improved treatment outcomes in an in vivo RA animal model.

The major pathogenesis is the functional impairment of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and the lack of insulin secretion. Although both type 1 and type 2 diabetes develop through distinct pathological mechanisms, they lead to the destruction and/or dysfunction of beta cells, resulting in inadequate beta cell mass to maintain normal blood glucose levels. For this reason, therapeutic agents capable of inducing beta cell proliferation can be considered a possible approach to restore beta cell abundance and treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Although several methods have been found to promote the replication of beta cells in animal models or cell lines, it is still challenging to promote the effective proliferation of beta cells in humans. This review highlights the different agents and mechanisms that facilitate pancreatic beta cell regeneration. Numerous small molecules have been discovered to influence beta cell proliferation, primarily by targeting cellular pathways such as DYRK1A, adenosine kinase, SIK, and glucokinase. Additionally, receptors for TGF-β, EGF, insulin, glucagon, GLP-1, SGLT2 inhibitors, and prolactin play critical roles in this process. Stem cell-based clinical trials are also underway to assess the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We have emphasized alternative therapeutic pathways and related strategies that may be employed to promote the regeneration of pancreatic beta cells. The knowledge raised within this review may help to understand the potential drug-inducible targets for beta cell regeneration and pave the way for further investigations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015107161

Their unique properties make them suitable for various therapeutic applications. This article reviews accepted methods and guidelines for the isolation and characterization of MSCs from various sources. Common sources include bone marrow, adipose tissue, perinatal and umbilical cord tissue, dental pulp, etc. Naturally, the techniques used to isolate MSCs can vary depending on the source from which they are derived. However, several methods have been widely accepted by the scientific community. These include enzymatic digestion, density gradient centrifugation, the use of Percoll, adherence-based techniques and selective culture conditions. To characterize MSCs, basic criteria established by the International Society for Cell and Tissue Transplantation and the International Federation for Adipose Tissue are routinely used. These criteria include the ability of MSCs to adhere to plastic surfaces under standard culture conditions, the expression of specific membrane markers and their differentiation potential. Various techniques are used to assess these characteristics, including mixed lymphocyte reactions, flow cytometry and immunophenotyping profiles. These assessments aim to confirm the purity of the MSCs and validate their mesenchymal properties. In summary, the isolation and characterization of MSCs requires careful consideration of the different available methods. Each source presents unique challenges and advantages. By following established guidelines, researchers can ensure successful isolation and characterization of MSCs.

However, there is a disparity in physical activity levels among women in the United States. These disparities are associated with differences in women’s mammography screening behaviors, which may contribute to disparities in breast cancer incidence and outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the association between physical activity and the utilization of mammography screening. It also assesses whether this association is modified by women’s race/ethnicity and age. Methods: This is a longitudinal study that used the Health and Retirement Study data from 2004 to 2016. A total of 18,157 women aged 40 years and older were included. The 2004 wave was used as the baseline, with follow-up conducted in 2008, 2012, and 2016 (wave 9, 11, and 13 respectively). Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used, and odds ratios were reported. Results: The study found a significant positive association between physical activity and mammography utilization. After adjusting for confounding variables, women who were physically active had 1.31 times the odds of undergoing mammography screening compared to those who were inactive (95% CI: 1.13–1.51, p < 0.001). The association between physical activity and mammography screening utilization was weaker among Hispanic women. Conclusion: Interventions encouraging physical activity targeting racial/ethnic minorities may contribute to increasing mammography screening utilization and reducing breast cancer disparity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015101166

Multi-organ transcriptomic analyses suggest that adipose tissue is among the earliest organs to respond to aging, characterized by changes in fat content and redistribution of adipose tissue, decline in thermogenic adipose function, reduced proliferation and differentiation capacity of adipose progenitor and stem cells, accumulation of senescent cells, and immunosenescence. These alterations may act synergistically and play a role in abnormalities in metabolic organs including the cardiovascular, liver, skeletal muscle, and brain. Studies have demonstrated that exercise ameliorates the effects of adipose tissue aging on metabolic organ abnormalities by inhibiting inflammation, reducing the accumulation of ectopic lipids, enhancing the browning of white adipose tissue and thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, improving lipid metabolism, regulating the secretion of adipokines, and mitigating immunosenescence.

Upon detecting oxygen deprivation, the body initiates a cardiorespiratory response that includes increased lung ventilation, vasoconstriction, and an increased heart rate to improve oxygen supply. Moreover, during hypoxia, there is stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), including HIF-1α and HIF-2α, where HIF-1α predominantly regulates genes involved in metabolic reprogramming and immediate stress response, and HIF-2α is engaged in sustaining vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin (EPO) gene expression. The brain is an extremely oxygen-dependent organ, as it uses one-fifth of the body’s oxygen at rest, making it particularly vulnerable during hypoxia. According to the literature, it results in metabolic changes in neurons via impacting various enzymatic activities, which further trigger inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, resulting in Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterised by α-synuclein aggregation, Lewy body formation, and dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra.

Subsequently, 6HPB@C<inf>60</inf> was loaded in the sodium alginate hydrogel to create an antioxidant system (6HPB@C<inf>60</inf> gel) for diabetic wound healing. 6HPB@C<inf>60</inf> gel exhibits a homogeneous and interconnected porous microstructure, demonstrating excellent tissue adhesion, low cytotoxicity, and excellent antioxidant capacity. Diabetic chronic wounds heal faster with 6HPB@C<inf>60</inf> gel, which eliminates reactive oxygen species continuously.

The pathogenesis of AKI is highly complex and heterogeneous, primarily attributed to metabolic disturbances arising from the disease itself and the administration of medications related to treatment. In recent years, AKI in cancer patients is highly concerned. The emergence of AKI caused injuries and dysfunction of remote organs but also enhanced the health-care costs. It's essential for early recognition of AKI by biomarker or prediction models and further, take a timely intervention. This review aims to provide the pathophysiology of AKI covering the intricate mechanisms underpinning AKI in the dynamic context of the clinical setting, the tailored role of inflammation and ischemia, and the cellular and molecular crosstalk pathways involved. These events closely related to patients at high risk of AKI and underscore the characteristics that may make these patients more susceptible to injury. Furthermore, the diagnosis of AKI relies on clinical criteria, biomarkers, and imaging, but it should be distinguished from CKD. Finally, the review offers the therapeutic intervention in clinical practice and preclinical or clinical trials, focusing on the improvement of conventional therapy and advanced novel treatment strategies. Simultaneously, the challenge and future direction on early identifying renal impairment and performing renoprotection are also discussed, further supporting the novel discipline including onco-nephrology. The development of effective interventions that reduce nephrotoxicity is highly contingent upon a thorough understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of AKI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015077428

Currently, approved therapeutic strategies for MASH are limited. Therefore, this study used the Connectivity Map (CMap) database to identify a candidate compound for MASH, evaluate its efficacy in experimental models, and explore its mechanism of action. Based on the gene expression profile of GSE126484, Sappanone A (SA) was screened using the CMap. In a palmitic acid-induced cell model, SA notably reduced the expression of fibrotic genes in LX-2 cells. In a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced MASH model, SA significantly attenuated liver injury, as evidenced by the reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase levels, alleviation of hepatic ballooning and inflammation. In a high-fat, methionine-restricted, choline-deficient (HFMRCD) diet-induced MASH model, SA remarkably improved lipid metabolism, ballooning, and inflammation. Importantly, SA markedly inhibited the progression of fibrosis. Network pharmacology results indicated that SA might alleviate MASH through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/(Mechanistic target of rapamycin) mTOR signaling pathway. We performed molecular docking, cellular thermal shift assay, and western blotting to validate that SA bound to and inhibited PI3K activity, thereby reducing the downstream phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR. Notably, the PI3K activator Recilisib weakened the inhibitory effect of SA on PA-induced p-AKT and COL1a1 in LX-2 cells, further confirming the dependence of SA on PI3K activity. In conclusion, we identified SA as a potential natural PI3K inhibitor and promising compound for the treatment of MASH. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015074307

Hyposecretion of dopamine (DA) is the end result in the pathology of Parkinson’s disease. Unfortunately, safe and efficient therapeutic drugs are deficient. Tyrosine hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme for DA synthesis, could hydroxylate tyrosine and generate levodopa with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) as an indispensable coenzyme. Furthermore, BH4 was confirmed to confer neuroprotection against Parkinson’s disease. Thus, regulation of BH4 synthesis was verified to become a promising therapeutic strategy for Parkinson’s disease. Results: We demonstrate that artemisinin effectively produced neuroprotection against Parkinson’s disease in rats. Integrated analysis of midbrain proteomics and non-targeted metabolomics suggests that artemisinin might target adenylate cyclase 5 (Adcy5) to increase GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (Gch1, BH4 synthetase) expression to further boost BH4 synthesis. To verify this hypothesis, molecular docking experiments demonstrate that ART could directly bind to Adcy5. Artemisinin increases Adcy5 and Gch1 expressions and BH4 production both in vivo and in vitro. Further rescue experiments demonstrate that artemisinin-generated DA neuroprotection and hypersecretion of DA and BH4 disappears after inhibition of Adcy5 or Gch1 in vitro. Additionally, suppression of Adcy5 aggravates Parkinson’s disease manifestation, decreases midbrain DA and BH4 production and down-regulated Gch1 expression in vivo. Conclusions: Artemisinin mediates neuroprotection against Parkinson’s disease via regulation of Adcy5-Gch1-BH4 axis in rats. These findings present a beneficial potential for future application of artemisinin on Parkinson’s disease treatment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015073990

In elderly populations, the increased proportion of senescent cells emerges as a fundamental determinant that substantially compromises regenerative outcomes. In senescent bone tissues, the progressive accumulation of senescent cells compromises bone regenerative capacity through multifaceted mechanisms, encompassing both intrinsic functional impairment of senescent cells and the far-reaching impact of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) on the surrounding cellular and tissue microenvironment. Advanced biomaterials provide a platform for targeted anti-senescence interventions. One strategy is the selective elimination of senescent cells, achieved by engineering materials as delivery systems for senolytics or as platforms that modulate immune clearance. A more nuanced approach seeks functional rejuvenation, using biomaterials to restore cellular homeostasis by mitigating inflammation, correcting metabolic dysfunction, and reprogramming gene expression. A holistic strategy remodels the senescent microenvironment itself, accomplished through materials designed to restore biochemical homeostasis, provide physical guidance, and reprogram biological communication. This review delineates these material-based strategies, from direct cellular targeting to comprehensive niche remodeling. We also evaluate the significant hurdles to clinical translation, including challenges in biological specificity, preclinical model fidelity, and regulatory pathways.

Herein, TP/SMP composite bioceramic scaffolds were prepared by combining strontium magnesium phosphate (SMP) and β-tricalcium phosphate (TP), with a pore structure created through extrusion-type 3D printing. During sintering, ion substitution along with chemical reactions occurred between TP and SMP. The porosity and mechanical properties of the TP/SMP scaffolds could be controlled through adjusting the sintering temperature and addition proportion of TP and SMP. Compared to individual TP or SMP scaffolds, the TP/SMP composite scaffolds exhibited markedly enhanced compression strength, and the 25TP/75SMP scaffolds prepared from 25 wt% TP and 75 wt% SMP exhibited the highest compression strength (41.4 MPa) after sintering at 1100 °C. The degradation rate of the 25TP/75SMP scaffolds was 2.91 % after 56 days of immersion in an aqueous solution. The degradation of TP/SMP scaffolds resulted in the release of strontium, magnesium and calcium ions, which enhanced cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium mineralization and osteogenesis-related gene expression of mouse bone mesenchymal stem cells.

The C-reactive protein (CRP)–albumin–lymphocyte (CALLY) index is a novel multidimensional biomarker combining systemic inflammation, nutritional status, and immune function. This study evaluated the association between the CALLY index and overall survival (OS) as well as recurrence-free survival (RFS) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Methods: In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, the medical characteristics of 1447 CRC patients who were treated at one of the medical centers affiliated with two universities of medical sciences between 2012 and 2022 were examined. Patients were divided into two groups based on the CALLY index: ≥ 2 (945 patients) and < 2 (502 patients). Demographic characteristics, tumor characteristics, and pathological findings of the patients were extracted by referring to the patient records. Results: The 5-year OS rate for patients with a CALLY index ≥ 2 was 80.3%, compared to 64.9% for those with a CALLY index < 2 (log-rank test = 68.2, P = 0.001). The multivariate analysis showed that the CALLY index was significantly associated with OS rate of patients, and OS rate was significantly higher in patients with a CALLY index ≥ 2 than in patients with a CALLY index < 2 (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73–0.95, P = 0.001). Also, based on these results, the patients’ age, mean BMI, tumor size, T stage, TNM stage, presence of metastasis, tumor location, number of involved lymph nodes, colon diseases, adjuvant chemotherapy, platelet level, and pathological tumor differentiation were all significantly associated with survival in CRC patients (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that a higher CALLY index is significantly correlated with improved survival outcomes and a reduced risk of recurrence in CRC patients. CALLY index can be helpful as a criterion for predicting the prognosis of patients with CRC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015053955

Mitochondrial dysfunction, associated with oxidative stress and apoptosis, is linked to various degenerative diseases. Melatonin has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for preventing IVDD because of its capacity to regulate cellular rhythms. The impact of melatonin on mitochondrial dysfunction and its underlying mechanisms is not yet fully understood. Firstly, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to evaluate nucleus pulposus (NP) cell viability treated with melatonin and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP). Then, Western blotting, immunofluorescence and tunnel staining were employed to explore the underlying mechanisms in vitro. Next, a needle-punctured rat model followed by radiographic analysis and immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate the potential effect of melatonin in vivo. This study demonstrated that AOPP triggered oxidative stress, exacerbated mitochondrial injury, and increased NP cell apoptosis. Additionally, melatonin enhanced mitochondrial function and protected NP cells from oxidative injury. Further studies demonstrated that melatonin enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and modulated mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy via the Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγcoactivator 1α (PGC-1α) signaling pathway, maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and thereby decreasing excessive apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. A PGC-1α inhibitor lessened melatonin’s effect on the mitochondrial quality system, weakening its protective function in NP cells against oxidative stress. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that melatonin slowed the progression of IVDD. These findings provide a theoretical basis for treating IVDD by targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and modulating the mitochondrial quality control system. Melatonin could be an effective treatment for IVDD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014947916

Abaloparatide (ABL), a synthetic analog of human PTHrP (1–34) and a clinical medication for treating osteoporosis, has recently demonstrated its potential in enhancing craniofacial bone formation. Herein, we show that intraoral submucosal injection of ABL, when combined with mechanical force, promotes in situ alveolar bone thickening. The newly formed bone is primarily located outside the original compact bone, implying its origin from the periosteum. RNA sequencing of the alveolar bone tissue revealed that the focal adhesion (FA) pathway potentially mediates this bioprocess. Local injection of ABL alone enhances cell proliferation, collagen synthesis, and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the alveolar periosteum; when ABL is combined with mechanical force, the FAK expression is upregulated, in line with the accomplishment of the ossification. In vitro, ABL enhances proliferation, migration, and FAK phosphorylation in periosteal stem cells. Furthermore, the pro-osteogenic effects of ABL on alveolar bone are entirely blocked when FAK activity is inhibited by a specific inhibitor. In summary, abaloparatide combined with mechanical force promotes alveolar bone formation via FAK-mediated periosteal osteogenesis. Thus, we have introduced a promising therapeutic approach for drug-induced in situ alveolar bone augmentation, which may prevent or repair the detrimental periodontal dehiscence, holding significant potential in dentistry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014946382

Alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis is a key pathological hallmark of PF, but the upstream regulators driving this process remain unclear. Caspase-9, a central initiator of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, has been implicated in fibrotic diseases across multiple organs. However, its role in lung fibrosis and its molecular interactions are not fully elucidated. Methods: Caspase-9 expression was analyzed in human PF lung tissues, bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse models, and TGF-β1-treated MLE-12 alveolar epithelial cells. Functional studies included pharmacological inhibition, siRNA knockdown, and overexpression of Caspase-9. Fibrosis and apoptosis were assessed using Western blot, qPCR, immunohistochemistry, TUNEL, and electron microscopy. Interaction with β-catenin was examined via co-localization, modulation, and rescue experiments. Results: Caspase-9 and cleaved-Caspase-9 were significantly upregulated in fibrotic lungs and TGF-β1-stimulated epithelial cells. Caspase-9 inhibition reduced collagen deposition, improved lung architecture, and suppressed pro-fibrotic markers in mice. In MLE-12 cells, Caspase-9 knockdown attenuated TGF-β1-induced apoptosis, restored E-cadherin, and downregulated fibrotic genes. Conversely, Caspase-9 overexpression aggravated fibrosis and apoptosis. Mechanistically, Caspase-9 interacted with β-catenin, enhanced its nuclear accumulation, and promoted downstream fibrotic signaling. β-catenin silencing reversed Caspase-9-induced fibrosis, while β-catenin activation nullified the protective effects of Caspase-9 inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. These results identify a functional Caspase-9/β-catenin axis in PF progression. Conclusions: Caspase-9 drives pulmonary fibrosis by promoting epithelial apoptosis and activating β-catenin signaling. Targeting the Caspase-9/β-catenin axis may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for PF. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014944733

The Chenghua (CH) pig, with exceptional skin thickness characteristics, provides a promising model for investigating human skin development and physiology. Results: We constructed a comprehensive single-cell RNA atlas of 443,529 cells from CH pig skin spanning 10 developmental stages (embryonic day 56 to postnatally year 7). Our analysis identified eight major skin cell types and revealed stage-specific shifts in cellular composition. Fibroblasts (FBs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) dominated embryonic development while smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells increased postnatally, with aging marked by FB dysfunction and significant dermal thinning. Pseudotime trajectory analysis identified that FBs differentiated from a common progenitor with MSCs, diverging into five functionally distinct subpopulations including papillary, reticular, mesenchymal, pro-inflammatory, and a novel AUTS2⁺ subtype with neuromodulatory roles. Critically, FBs regulated postnatal skin aging via COL1A1-(ITGA1 + ITGB1) and MDK-SDC1 interaction signaling pathways, with the transcription factor EGR1 regulating collagen-related genes (DPT, COL12A1, COL5A2) during development; the age-dependent suppression of FBs coincided with collagen downregulation, reduced intercellular communication, and elevated transcriptional noise. Concurrently, immune cells including dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells (TCs) exhibited a marked decrease of cell numbers perinatally, with cytotoxic NKT cells reaching peak abundance at rapid growth stage; DCs and TCs primarily utilized SPP1 and TGF-β signaling pathways to regulate skin immunity during development and aging. Cross-species analysis confirmed the evolutionary conservation of skin cell types and FB functional gene profiles related to ECM deposition and inflammatory responses across pigs, humans, and mice during development and aging. Conclusions: This work delineates cellular dynamics underpinning skin homeostasis, uncovers the vital physiological functions of FBs and immune cells during skin development and aging, and validates the pig model for human cutaneous physiology research. The atlas serves as a pivotal resource for skin mechanistic and translational studies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014943172

Methods: In this study, the mRNA was extracted from the cortical tissues and brain microvessels of male and female mice aged 3 months and 10 months to detect the expression of important BBB-related genes by qPCR. Results: Under physiological conditions, compared with age-matched male counterparts, female mice reported a significantly lower mRNA expression of tight junction-related genes (cldn5 and occludin), transporters (Glut1 and D-gp), pericyte marker (Pdgfrb), microvessel marker (Cd31), basement membrane component (Col4a2), glycocalyx-related genes (Hs3st1, Extl2, and Clgalt), vascular homeostasis-related genes (Hif1a, Ddit4, and Pik3ca), and some regulatory genes (Adm, Zfpm2 and Nr3c1).

Current clinical management relies on lifestyle modifications and symptom-targeted therapies due to the absence of curative interventions. In recent years, Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD), a surgical procedure that induces controlled ovarian damage to stimulate primordial follicle activation and regulate follicular growth, has emerged as an established therapeutic intervention for infertility in PCOS. Beyond surgical approaches, the 740Y-P peptide—PI3K-Akt pathway agonist can achieve similar effects to LOD in enhancing follicular activation and restoring fertility. However, translating 740Y-P into clinical practice remains challenging due to systemic delivery limitations, including poor bioavailability and inadequate ovarian targeting. To address this, naturally secreted sEVs have gained attention as versatile therapeutic vectors owing to their intrinsic immunomodulatory properties and homing tendency. Methods: In this study, We engineered HucMSC-sEVs through anchor peptide-mediated surface Connections to deliver the 740Y-P peptide. The N-terminus of 740Y-P was conjugated to the C-terminus of the CD63-binding anchor peptide, enabling exogenous loading via co-incubation (4 °C, 12h). Engineered sEVs were characterized for peptide loading efficiency and targeting capability. PCOS model mice were treated by tail vein injection. The phenotype studies were explored by glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, ovarian weight, ovarian morphometric analysis, follicle counts and litter size. The mechanisms were also investigated by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, western blot, RT-qPCR and TUNEL assays. And compared the different efficacy of 740Y-P peptide, sEVs, and 740Y-P loaded sEVs. Results: Our results demonstrated that sEVs functioned as dual-effect agents—serving both as immunomodulators and targeted delivery vehicles for 740Y-P, significantly improved ovarian microenvironment and enhanced ovarian targeting efficiency of 740Y-P. The engineered sEVs restored estrous cycles, ameliorated glucose-insulin homeostasis, reduced ovarian inflammation and granulosa cell apoptosis. Additionally, activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to promote follicular maturation, reduce ovarian cyst formation and ultimately increase litter size, improving metabolic and reproductive outcomes in PCOS mice. Conclusions: In this study, we engineered sEVs to deliver the 740Y-P peptide, demonstrating their capacity to mitigate ovarian inflammation, normalize follicular development, and enhance fertility in a PCOS mouse model. These findings propose a novel therapeutic strategy for PCOS, pending further optimization of delivery protocols and clinical validation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014942454

Understanding the organization and function of the three-dimensional (3D) genome is critical to profile chromatin accessibility and functional interactions that govern gene regulation across multiple biological processes, including aging and one of its hallmarks, cellular senescence. Cellular senescence constitutes a defensive stress response to various intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli, preserving cellular and organismal homeostasis through a generally irreversible cell cycle arrest. In this review article we discuss epigenetic alterations occurring to DNA and chromatin that drive and fuel the onset of this complex phenomenon. As such, we describe major large-scale chromatin events, including the formation of higher-order chromatin structures and the 3D spatial alterations of the genome that occur during senescence. We also discuss global heterochromatin loss, deficiencies in nuclear lamins, the depletion of core histones and their modifications, as well as the epigenetic regulation of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), all of which serve key roles in the epigenome of senescent cells. To clearly demonstrate the significance of epigenetic modifications, data from a computational meta-analysis are presented, aiming to further underpin key epigenetic mechanisms occurring in senescent cells. Last, we highlight promising epigenetic modulators implemented in therapeutic strategies for senescent cell detection and elimination, possibly leading to significant clinical advances against various age-related diseases as well as the delay and prevention of the aging onset. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014941882

GPCRs transduce extracellular stimuli and signals into intracellular responses, enabling precise cellular communication for physiology and homeostasis. Given their ability to sense a variety of ligands, GPCRs regulate a plethora of physiological functions, such as sensory perception, hormonal regulation and metabolism, growth and development, cardiovascular and reproductive regulation. GPCRs also orchestrate immune responses, triggering a balanced pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling, which is linked to the development, differentiation, and regulation of B-cells that are responsible for the secretion of infection-fighting antibodies. However, an imbalance in inflammatory signaling is also linked to disruption of B-cell differentiation, leading to autoimmune diseases due to increased levels of autoantibodies. Additionally, GPCRs modulate neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, influencing behaviour, mood, and cognitive functions. Due to their diverse functionality, ∼40 % of FDA-approved, currently marketed drugs are reported to target different GPCRs for therapeutic benefit. A focal point of this review is GPCR-driven neuroinflammation, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, including others.

SCA3, the most common form worldwide, is caused by CAG repeat expansions in ATXN3, resulting in pathogenic ataxin-3 aggregation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms driving disease progression remain incompletely understood. Methods: We utilized an integrated multi-omics strategy to investigate a five-generation Chinese HA pedigree. Genetic analyses included targeted ataxia panel sequencing (TS), whole-exome sequencing (WES), and long-read whole-genome sequencing (LR-WGS) of blood-derived DNA to identify causal variants and confirm diagnosis. Transcriptomic profiling revealed disease-associated gene expression signatures, followed by functional annotation and cross-species validation. To ensure analytical rigor, we further validated our bioinformatic pipeline using an independent ulcerative colitis (UC) dataset. Results: Genetic analysis identified pathogenic ATXN3-CAG repeat expansions that co-segregated with clinical symptoms in affected family members. Transcriptomic profiling showed significant enrichment in ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion pathways, along with immune dysregulation and RNA splicing defects associated with disease progression. Cross-species analysis discovered conserved blood biomarkers (C3/ALS2/SLC35A2↓ and THBS1/CAMTA1↑), strongly correlated with clinical progression. Protein-protein interaction network emphasized AKT1 as a central regulator, along with other key hubs (e.g., TGFB1, MAPK3, CALM3, APP), while brain-specific analyses highlighted Mobp, Mal, Gja1 and Klk6 as potential therapeutic targets. Conclusions: This study genetically confirms SCA3 in a Chinese pedigree using LR-WGS, overcoming the diagnostic limitations of short-read sequencing. Comprehensive analyses revealed conserved SCA3 progression signatures with potential biomarkers for future non-invasive monitoring. Mechanistically, this study identified dysregulation in ECM-receptor interaction/focal adhesion, immune response, and RNA splicing as key pathogenic contributors. These findings provide both actionable therapeutic targets and demonstrate the clinical utility of integrated multi-omics approaches for SCA3 diagnosis and patient stratification, with broader implications for repeat expansion disorders.

DN mouse models are important tools for studying the mechanisms of DN and exploring therapeutic strategies. Common features of the renal pathology in diabetic patients include thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, mesangial expansion, glomerulosclerosis, tubular injury, and interstitial fibrosis. Although DN mouse models generated through pharmacological or genetic approaches demonstrate comparable renal structural changes, the existing DN mouse models fail to replicate the severity of human DN pathology, underscoring the need for further research to develop more precise DN mouse models. Mouse models with renal pathology that better matches the human condition would provide a key platform for identifying potential therapeutic targets and developing new drugs. This review summarizes the advantages and limitations of various DN mouse models, including pharmacological and dietary induction models, genetically engineered models, spontaneous models generated via genetic modification, and models developed by combined modeling approaches. The goal of this review is to provide valuable insights and guidance for the construction of more comprehensive DN models.

It exhibits significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic properties, making it a promising therapeutic compound for fibrotic illnesses, including pulmonary fibrosis. The condition is distinguished by excessive extracellular matrix formation in lung tissue, resulting in stiffness and reduced respiratory performance. Current treatments, limited to nintedanib and pirfenidone, merely slow disease progression, highlighting the need for more effective therapeutic options. Main body: Luteolin exerts its effects by modulating key signaling pathways, including transforming growth factor-beta/small mothers against decapentaplegic (TGF-β/SMAD), phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), thereby reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. In vitro and pre-clinical studies also support its therapeutic potential. Furthermore, network pharmacology has identified multiple hub targets of luteolin and highlighted its synergistic interactions with other bioactive compounds. These interactions contribute to enhanced biological outcomes such as cell cycle deceleration, apoptosis induction, and angiogenesis inhibition in inflammatory conditions and cancers. However, poor bioavailability and targeted delivery challenges limit luteolin’s clinical utility. To overcome these issues, nanoparticle-based delivery systems, including nanosuspensions, solid lipid nanoparticles, and polymeric nanoparticles, have been developed to enhance their lung-targeted delivery and therapeutic efficacy. Conclusion: This narrative review outlines luteolin’s multiple molecular targets, pathways, and mechanisms in modulating fibrotic diseases, especially lung fibrosis, and emphasizes the gap between current formulation strategies and clinical translation. Advanced delivery technologies hold promise for enhancing luteolin’s therapeutic value. Hence, additional investigation is needed to establish its effectiveness as well as its safety in clinical settings and develop luteolin as a viable treatment option for chronic respiratory diseases, particularly pulmonary fibrosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014938210

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising therapeutics, yet the optimal donor cell source is still undetermined, as both donor cell type and age significantly influence EV therapeutic efficacy. This study evaluates the therapeutic potential of EVs derived from ovine fetal articular chondrocytes (fCCs) and ovine fetal umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stromal cells (fMSCs) compared to EVs from two immortalized human perinatal cell lines, Wharton’s jelly (WJ-MSCs) and amnion MSCs (P-MSCs), on inflamed ovine adult chondrocytes and synoviocytes in vitro. Methods: EVs were isolated from conditioned media using tangential flow filtration and characterized by size, concentration, and EV markers. Inflamed adult articular chondrocytes and synoviocytes were treated with 1E + 09 particles/mL of each EV source. EV’s cellular uptake was assessed via live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy. Therapeutic effects were evaluated through proliferation, wound healing assays, and multi-omics (RNASeq, proteomics) analyses at 24 and 48 h post-treatment. Results: All EVs were successfully internalized by inflamed ovine and human chondrocytes. Donor cell type significantly influenced incorporation with fCC-EVs achieving the highest uptake across conditions. All treatments reduced pro-inflammatory genes and upregulated growth and cell cycle-related genes. Fetal-derived EVs induced more robust transcriptional changes and enriched signaling pathways than perinatal-derived EVs. Notably, fCC-EVs exhibited the most pronounced effects on inflamed chondrocytes, while fMSC-EVs were most effective on synoviocytes. Donor cell age emerged as a more influential factor in therapeutic efficacy than cell type. Conclusions: The ontogenetic stage of donor cells plays a crucial role in EV’s therapeutic efficacy, with fetal-derived EVs demonstrating superior outcomes compared to perinatal-derived EVs. The distinct effects of fCC-EVs and fMSC-EVs suggest that a combinatorial approach using both EV types could optimize therapeutic outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014936161

As adropin is a key regulator of cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis, this study investigated its therapeutic effects against HFpEF pathogenesis. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (60% fat-derived calories) with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 0.5 g/L) in drinking water for 8 weeks to induce HFpEF. Adropin-knockout (Ad⁻/⁻) mice were generated, and HFpEF mice received a single intraperitoneal bolus of recombinant adropin (450 nmol kg⁻¹). Cardiac structure and function were quantified by echocardiography. Metabolic status was documented (body weight, fasting glucose, lipids, and systolic/diastolic blood pressure). Myocardial morphology, fibrosis and cardiomyocyte size were examined by hematoxylin‒eosin, Masson’s trichrome and wheat‒germ agglutinin staining. Oxidative stress was evaluated with dihydroethidium fluorescence (ROS) and biochemical assays for malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). The protein expression of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO-1 and apoptosis markers (Bcl-2/Bax) was determined by immunoblotting. Results: HFpEF mice developed significant metabolic disturbances, diastolic dysfunction, myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and increased oxidative stress, alongside markedly reduced serum and myocardial adropin levels. Adropin supplementation improved glucose and lipid metabolism, reduced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and enhanced diastolic function, whereas adropin knockout exacerbated these pathologies. Mechanistically, adropin activated the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, increased the expression of antioxidant enzymes (HO-1 and NQO-1), reduced the expression of oxidative stress markers, and regulated apoptosis by increasing Bcl-2 and decreasing Bax expression. HFpEF mice exhibited significant metabolic disturbances, diastolic dysfunction, myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and elevated oxidative stress, alongside markedly reduced serum and myocardial adropin levels. Adropin treatment improved glucose/lipid metabolism, attenuated hypertrophy/fibrosis, and enhanced diastolic function, whereas adropin knockout exacerbated these pathologies. Mechanistically, adropin activated the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, upregulated antioxidant enzymes (HO-1, NQO-1), reduced oxidative stress markers, and mitigated apoptosis by increasing Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Conclusion: Adropin improves HFpEF by attenuating metabolic dysregulation, oxidative stress, and myocardial remodeling. Mechanistically, adropin activates the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for HFpEF. These findings highlight the potential of adropin to reduce disease burden and improve quality of life in HFpEF patients, addressing critical gaps in current HFpEF management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014933078

In senescent cells, activation of intracellular cascade induces epigenetic, morphological and metabolic changes. Among them, senescent status is characterized by an alteration of the epigenome and the establishment of a peculiar senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which contributes to the extracellular matrix remodeling and senescence spreading. Growing interest is directed towards senescence relevance both in physiological processes and in pathological ones, including rare progeroid syndromes. However, little is known about senescence contribution to the onset and development of rare diseases in which aging traits are not manifested. Main body: Here, we review the current knowledge about senescence involvement in four rare mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery (i.e. chromatinopathies) and four rare lung diseases, that can be considered a paradigm for understanding how epigenome alteration and aberrant microenvironment modification in senescence process might drive disease onset and progression. First, we report the main characteristics of chromatinopathies and the relation between the chromatin-related epigenetic defects and the senescence features in Sotos syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Rett syndrome, and Kleefstra syndromes. Thereafter, we describe the pathological alteration and senescence involvement in cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension and lymphangioleiomyomatosis, considering them as models of rare lung diseases in which accumulation of senescent cells and their proinflammatory SASP have a central role. Conclusion: Exploring the role of senescence in different and less common diseases might promote the understanding of the senescent process as a novel player in rare disorders, for a more comprehensive vision of their complexity and the suggestion of novel possible therapeutical targets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014931178

High-resolution technologies, including single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, have revealed the high heterogeneity, functional diversity, and spatial distribution within the CAF population. Significant differences exist in the interactions between distinct CAF subpopulations and immune cells.

Consensus clustering analysis was performed based on differentially expressed SRGs (DE-SRGs). The functional enrichment and immune features between cellular senescence-related clusters were explored. Moreover, two machine learning algorithms were used to select the candidate biomarkers for osteoporotic diagnosis. Fifty-four clinical samples were collected and used to validate the expression levels of diagnostic biomarkers using qPCR. Results: A total of 2,706 DEGs (1,587 upregulated and 1,119 downregulated) were identified in osteoporosis.

Among others, aging individuals are particularly vulnerable to the effects of wildfire smoke. In this study, we assessed the neurobiological impacts of wood smoke (WS) on aged mice and the potential of anti-aging therapeutics to mitigate these impacts. Methods: Female C57BL/6 J mice, aged 18 months, were divided into 10 groups and exposed to either filtered air (FA; 5 groups) or biomass derived WS (5 groups) for 4 h/day, every other day, for 14 days (7 exposures total) with an average particulate matter (PM) concentration of 448 µg/m3 per exposure. One FA control group and one WS exposed group were euthanized 24 h after the last exposure. The remaining 8 groups (4 FA and 4 WS exposed) were treated with either vehicle control, resveratrol and nicotinamide mononucleotide (RNMN), dasatinib and quercetin (DQ), or both RNMN and DQ (RNDQ) for 10 weeks. Results: A significant reduction in NAD + within the prefrontal cortex was observed following the 14-day exposure to WS along with a reduction in serotonin. Serotonin reductions were observed up to 10 weeks post-exposure and co-occurred with neuroinflammation and behavioral alterations, including increased immobility in a forced swim test. RNMN conferred the greatest mitigating effect after WS exposure, while RNDQ treatment resulted in an upregulation of markers associated with aging in the brain. While the metabolic shift in the PFC following WS exposure was relatively modest, mice exposed to FA and vehicle control (10 weeks of natural aging) exhibited the greatest metabolic shift, including perturbed nicotinamide metabolism. Conclusion: Taken together, these findings highlight that subacute (14-day) exposure to WS results in persistent neurometabolomic and behavioral alterations in an aged mouse model and that intervention with RNMN may be a useful strategy to mitigate the adverse neurological outcomes observed. Further studies are needed to assess the specific impact of either resveratrol or NMN in isolation and to fully elucidate age-specific, as well as sex- and species-determinant, WS exposure response pathways. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014926672

Paracrine signaling from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) plays a critical role in bone repair, but the impact of LIPUS on MSC-derived secretome remains unclear. This study investigates whether LIPUS enhances the osteogenic and angiogenic potential of MSCs through modulation of growth factor secretion. Methods: Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) were treated with or without LIPUS to generate conditioned media (LIPUS-CM and Ctrl-CM). Concentrations of IGF-1, VEGF, and TGF-β were quantified. These media were applied to other BMSCs and rat aortic endothelial cells (RAOECs). In vitro assays evaluated cell proliferation, migration, osteogenic differentiation, and angiogenesis. Data were analyzed using GraphPad and Image J, with significance set at α = 0.05. Results: LIPUS significantly upregulated IGF-1 and VEGF secretion in BMSCs, while TGF-β levels remained unchanged. RAOECs cultured in LIPUS-CM demonstrated enhanced proliferation, migration, and angiogenic capacity. Likewise, BMSCs cultured in LIPUS-CM showed improved proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation compared to the Ctrl-CM group. Conclusion: LIPUS promotes osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and angiogenesis in RAOECs through the paracrine signaling of BMSCs, at least by increasing IGF-1 and VEGF secretion. This suggests that LIPUS can regulate the secretome of BMSCs and may serve as a key mechanism in promoting bone tissue regeneration. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014926379

One critical mediator of inflammation in periodontitis is pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death linked to inflammatory processes. Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a key player in pyroptosis, where its cleavage forms membrane pores, leading to cell rupture and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18 creating an environment that favors cancer cell survival and proliferation. In periodontitis, pyroptosis is closely associated with the activation of inflammasomes, particularly NLRP3, in response to oral bacteria, which in turn leads to the release of cytokines that exacerbate inflammation. Furthermore, the tissue breakdown caused by pyroptosis releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which can activate oncogenic signaling in neighboring epithelial cells, further promoting oral cancers development. So, inhibiting pyroptotic mediators like GSDMD or NLRP3 inflammasomes can reduce inflammation in periodontitis and slow oral cancer progression. Interestingly, inducing pyroptosis in cancer cells or infected tissues may offer a potential therapeutic approach. These findings underscore the critical link between periodontitis, pyroptosis, and oral cancer, suggesting that targeting these pathways may offer therapeutic potential for preventing or treating both diseases. This review aims to elucidate the role of pyroptosis in periodontitis, their impacts on oral cancers, and the potential therapeutic strategies to modulate this inflammatory cell death. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014925965

Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a secreted trimeric glycoprotein with multiple functions. It can bind to various cell-surface receptors and is downregulated in OA chondrocytes. However, the utility of TSP-1 as a biomarker for OA remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between serum TSP-1 concentration and knee OA. Design: We quantified serum TSP-1 concentrations in mice with post-traumatic OA (PTOA) and age-dependent OA (ADOA) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We statistically analyzed the correlation between TSP-1 concentration and OA severity. Additionally, we generated cartilage-specific TSP-1 knockout mice and assessed TSP-1 concentration in the serum. Finally, we measured the concentrations of TSP-1 in the serum and synovial fluid of patients with OA and conducted statistical analyses to evaluate the correlation between TSP-1 concentration and Outerbridge grading. ROC curve analysis was used to determine the diagnostic value of TSP-1 for OA. Results: Serum TSP-1 concentration was reduced in wild-type mice with PTOA or ADOA and negatively correlated with OA severity. In cartilage-specific TSP-1 knockout mice, serum TSP-1 levels were decreased. In patients with OA, serum and synovial fluid TSP-1 levels were reduced and negatively correlated with OA severity. These findings suggest that TSP-1 may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of OA. Conclusion: Serum TSP-1 concentration is associated with OA severity in both mice and humans and may serve as a useful diagnostic biomarker for OA. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014923970

This review critically evaluates the molecular mechanisms underlying CICI, with a particular focus on the insights gained from transcriptomic analyses. As cancer incidence rises globally, understanding the complex interplay between chemotherapy agents and their cognitive repercussions becomes increasingly vital. Key mechanisms implicated in CICI include blood-brain barrier disruption, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress as a result of various chemotherapy treatments, such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, and paclitaxel. We delve into advanced transcriptomic methodologies including RNA sequencing, cDNA microarrays, and single-cell transcriptomics that elucidate the alteration in gene expression profiles associated with CICI and provide a deeper understanding of the underlying pathophysiological processes. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of developing comprehensive single-cell atlases and employing spatial transcriptomics to uncover cellular heterogeneity and the spatial dynamics of gene expression across different brain regions. This review consolidates the existing literature on the transcriptomic profile of CICI, highlighting potential genes and pathways while suggesting future research avenues aimed at mitigating cognitive dysfunction.

Recently, plant-derived extracellular vesicle-like particles (EVLP) have shown promise in their multifaceted functions. Objectives: The neuroprotective advantages that EVLP produced from Houttuynia cordata Thunb against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury are investigated. Methods: The extraction of HT-EVLP was performed using gradient centrifugation and ultracentrifugation, followed by identification of its particle size, morphology, and exosomal marker proteins. Using behavioral tests and a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), the neuroprotective attributes of HT-EVLP were assessed. To evaluate the effect of HT-EVLP on ferroptosis and cell survival, the oxygen–glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced HT22 cell model was used. Utilizing bioinformatics analysis and small RNA sequencing, the miRNA composition and downstream target genes of HT-EVLP were predicted. The dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was used to confirm that miR159a bound to long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthase 4 (ACSL4). The impact of miR159a transfection on OGD/R-induced ferroptosis in HT22 cell was also observed. Results: Using a MCAO model, we found that HT-EVLP preserved blood brain barrier integrity, naturally penetrated the infarct core area, reduced cerebral infarct volume, mitigated neuronal apoptosis and ferroptosis, and facilitated recovery of neuronal function. In vitro studies further revealed that HT-EVLP enhanced cell survival and suppressed ACSL4-mediated ferroptosis in OGD/R-treated HT22 cells. Small RNA sequencing indicated that HT-EVLP are rich in miRNAs, with miR159a, among the top 10, potentially regulating ferroptosis-related pathways and directly binding to the 3’UTR of ACSL4. Overexpression of miR159a reduced Erastin-induced ACSL4 expression and alleviated mitochondrial damage in HT22 cells without causing toxicity. Conclusions: This study highlights the potential of HT-EVLP as carriers of endogenous miR159a, offering a promising strategy for ischemic brain injury therapy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014919903

This systematic review aims to evaluate the current in vitro and in vivo evidence regarding the potential applications of platelet-derived products in various domains of male reproductive health, including in vitro spermatogenesis, sperm preservation, treatment of male infertility, mitigation of testicular toxicity, and management of testicular torsion/detorsion (T/D) injury. Strategy: This review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and was prospectively registered in PROSPERO. A comprehensive and language-unrestricted search was performed across major databases, including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. Studies published up to October 2024 were included, with an update in January 2025. Three reviewers independently screened and selected studies, with discrepancies resolved through discussion or consultation with a fourth reviewer. Results: A total of 43 studies met the inclusion criteria. Available evidence suggests that PRP and PRGF supplementation in culture media may enhance in vitro sperm generation by improving cell viability and proliferation. Their incorporation into sperm incubation and cryopreservation protocols has also been associated with improved motility, viability, and structural integrity. In vivo studies indicate that intratesticular PRP injections may offer therapeutic benefits for male infertility, potentially supporting improvements in sperm parameters, hormonal balance, and testicular tissue restoration. Additionally, PRP has been reported to reduce testicular toxicity and ischemia–reperfusion injury, possibly through antioxidative and tissue-reparative mechanisms.

This study investigated the role and underlying molecular mechanism of Rhomboid 5 homolog 2 (RHBDF2) in neuroinflammation during CIRI. Methods: The in vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) mouse model and in vitro HMC3 microglia subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) were established to mimic CIRI. Real-time PCR, western blot, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to confirm RHBDF2 expression and explore the molecular mechanism of microglia-specific RHBDF2 knockdown in CIRI. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation was used to detect the m6A methylation level of RHBDF2 mRNA both in vivo and in vitro. RNA sequencing analysis was performed in OGD/R-treated HMC3 cells with or without RHBDF2 knockdown. Results: Our finding showed that RHBDF2 expression increased in both in vivo and in vitro CIRI models. Microglial-specific RHBDF2 knockdown reduced brain injury in MCAO/R mice, as evidenced by the reduction in the cerebral infarct volume and amelioration of the neurological deficits. Furthermore, we demonstrated that RHBDF2 knockdown alleviated neuroinflammation by inhibiting microglial M1 polarization and promoting microglial M2 polarization in MCAO/R mouse ischemic penumbra. Mechanistically, RHBDF2 interacted with STING and promoted the activation of the STING-TBK1-IRF3/p65 signaling pathway. Rescue experiments confirmed that RHBDF2 knockdown suppressed inflammation via the inhibition of STING-TBK1 signaling pathway. In addition, the m6A methylation level of RHBDF2 mRNA was significantly increased in the MCAO/R mouse brain tissues and OGD/R-treated HMC3 cells. YTHDF1 recognized the m6A sites of RHBDF2 and promote its expression in an m6A manner. Through RNA-seq, the possible downstream effectors of RHBDF2 in CIRI was predicted. Conclusions: Microglial-specific RHBDF2 knockdown inhibits neuroinflammation in CIRI via STING-TBK1 signaling pathway, and is positively regulated by the m6A reader YTHDF1. This suggests RHBDF2 as a potential therapeutic target in ischemic stroke. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014915771

We showed that inhibition of TGFβ receptor type 1 (TGFβR1) mitigates the effect of alcohol in the lung. We further demonstrated that alcohol modulates TGFβ signaling, partly through its ability to modify microRNA (miRNA or miR) expressions in the lung. The mechanism by which alcohol mediates miRNA expressions and how its connection to TGFβ signaling has not been well elucidated. Circular RNAs (circRNAs or circ) have emerged as potential therapeutic targets due to their stability, tissue specificity, and ability to modify miRNAs. Human and murine lung fibroblasts (LF) were treated ± ethanol (60 mM). Samples were analyzed for TGFβR1 and circ-RORβ levels. In silico analysis was performed to identify common miRNAs with binding sites for both TGFβR1 and circ-RORβ. The top 10 miRNA levels in human LF (HLF) ± ethanol were analyzed. Human LF were treated with circ-RORβ anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO) ± ethanol, and samples were collected for miR-140-3p, TGFβR1, fibronectin (FN1), and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) levels, and stress fiber formation analyses. In parallel, HLF were treated with mimic miR-140-3p and analyzed for TGFβR1 mRNA levels. HLF were treated ± RORβ silencing RNA, then analyzed for RORβ, circ-RORβ, miR-140-3p, and TGFβR1 levels. We showed that ethanol upregulates TGFβR1 and circ-RORβ in ethanol-treated LF. In silico analysis revealed that miR-140-3p has putative binding sites for both TGFβR1 3’ untranslated region (UTR) and circ-RORβ. We demonstrated that ethanol exposure attenuated LF ‘s miR-140-3p expression, and inhibition of circ-RORβ abrogated ethanol-mediated miR-140-3p suppression. Inhibition of circ-RORβ attenuated ethanol-induced TGFβR1, FN1, and αSMA expressions, as well as αSMA stress fiber formation in LF, while inhibition of RORβ did not alter circ-RORβ, miR-140-3p, or TGFβR1 levels. Overexpression of miR-140-3p promotes TGFβR1 mRNA degradation and inhibits ethanol-induced TGFβR1 expression while has no impact on circ-RORβ level. Taken together, our findings suggest the potential role of circ-RORβ-miR-140-3p-TGFβR1 axis in alcohol-induced TGFβ signaling and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014912552

This study evaluates the differences in efficacy and cost-effectiveness between the two therapies. Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed 257 patients with knee osteoarthritis from October 2021 to November 2023, and divided them into PRP injection group and hypertonic glucose injection group according to their different treatment methods. All patients underwent a 4-week treatment. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores were compared at baseline and 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 weeks after treatment. Additionally, differences in the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores and total expenses during the treatment period were assessed between the two groups at the same time points. Results: At 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment, the VAS and WOMAC scores of the hypertonic glucose injection group were lower than those of the PRP injection group. Conversely, at 16 and 32 weeks post-treatment, the PRP injection group demonstrated lower VAS and WOMAC scores than the hypertonic glucose injection group. Similarly, SF-36 scores at 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment were higher in the hypertonic glucose injection group, whereas at 16 and 32 weeks, the PRP injection group achieved higher SF-36 scores. Regarding cost-effectiveness, the total cost for the PRP injection group was 362.4, while for the hypertonic glucose injection group, it was 87.4, making the latter more economical. Conclusion: Both PRP and hypertonic glucose injections significantly alleviate knee pain and improve joint function, enhancing patients’ quality of life. However, hypertonic glucose injections demonstrate superior short-term efficacy and lower costs. PRP injections, in contrast, provide better medium- to long-term outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014912041

Despite improvements in neonatal care, there are few therapies that actively promote healing or prevent long-term damage. In recent years, secretions from mesenchymal stem cells, rich in reparative proteins and tiny extracellular particles have shown promise as a safe and effective way to support tissue repair without the risks of live-cell therapy. Methods: This review brings together findings from animal studies and early-stage clinical trials to explore how these stem cell-derived secretions work and how they might be used in the clinic. We examine how different sources of mesenchymal stem cells, such as bone marrow or umbilical cord affect the quality and function of their secretions. We also look at key biological pathways they influence, including inflammation control, blood vessel growth, and tissue regeneration. In parallel, we assess the designs and outcomes of current clinical trials involving preterm infants. Results: In animal models, these secretions have repeatedly shown the ability to reduce lung and gut injury, calm inflammation, and boost repair mechanisms. Products from umbilical cord tissue appear especially potent, delivering high levels of protective molecules while being low in immunogenic risk. Several small clinical studies report that the approach is safe and well-tolerated in preterm infants, with some signs of benefit. However, clinical use is still limited by variability in production methods and the lack of standardized dosing. Conclusions: Mesenchymal stem cell secretions could offer a powerful new way to treat fragile preterm infants, providing regenerative support without the risks of cell transplantation. But before they become part of routine care, we need clearer guidance on how to manufacture, measure, and safely deliver these therapies in newborns. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014893371

Formerly referred to as interstitial Cajal-like cells, telocytes are capable of forming a complex communication network between various stromal and epithelial cell types. Despite their positive staining for CD34 and vimentin antibodies, the mesenchymal origin of these cells, as well as whether telocytes should be considered distinct cell populations or just a subpopulation of other stromal cells, remains uncertain. Telocytes have been shown to perform various functions, ranging from establishing complex three-dimensional networks, serving as an important component of stem cell niches and playing a huge role in the formation of tissue barriers, to serving as one of the key regulators of cell differentiation, having immune functions, and taking part in angiogenesis and even in organ morphogenesis. The functional diversity exhibited by telocytes in different tissues makes their study more complicated, and the exact molecular mechanisms underlying their function remain inadequately understood. As a new and intriguing field of research, telocytes hold considerable promise for improving our understanding of connective tissue physiology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Short survey,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014891822

This study investigates whether the combination of bovine collagen artificial nerve conduit (BCANC) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can mitigate the adverse effects of epineurotomy and promote more effective sensory and motor nerve recovery.A total of 222 patients (ages 16–75) with incomplete peripheral nerve injuries were enrolled. The test group underwent epineurotomy combined with BCANC and PRP implantation, while the control group received epineurotomy alone. Sensory and motor recovery were evaluated using electromyography and clinical measures at 1 and 3 months post-surgery, with analyses stratified by nerve type (Median, Ulnar, Radial). For median nerve injuries, the test group showed significant improvements across multiple electrophysiological parameters; clinically, both muscle strength (MRC scale, 3 months, p = 0.008) and sensory function (MRC scale, 1 and 3 months, p < 0.05) were significantly enhanced. For ulnar nerve injuries, significant electrophysiological improvements were observed; however, clinical muscle strength and sensory function did not significantly differ. For radial nerve injuries, part of electrophysiological parameters significantly improved in the test group, and clinical sensory function (3 months, p = 0.030) was also significantly better, while muscle strength showed no significant difference. Overall functional evaluation (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score) did not significantly differ between groups for any nerve type. No severe complications were noted. BCANC with PRP following epineurotomy is safe and yields significant short-term electrophysiological improvements for median, ulnar, and radial nerve injuries. Clinically, benefits included enhanced muscle strength and sensory function for median nerves, and improved sensory function for radial nerves; ulnar nerve clinical recovery and overall DASH scores were not significantly different. These findings suggest nerve-dependent clinical benefits, and further long-term studies are warranted. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014888968

In OA cartilage, the pathological manifestations show elevated chondrocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis. The mitochondrion serves as key energy supporter in eukaryotic cells and is tightly linked to a myriad of diseases including OA. As age advances, mitochondrial function declines progressively, which leads to an imbalance in chondrocyte energy homeostasis, partially initiating the process of cartilage degeneration. Elevated oxidative stress, impaired mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics jointly contribute to chondrocyte pathology, with mitochondrial DNA haplogroups, particularly haplogroup J, influencing OA progression. Therapeutic approaches directed at mitochondria have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in treating various diseases, with triphenylphosphonium (TPP) emerging as the most widely utilized molecule. Other strategies encompass Dequalinium (DQA), the Szeto-Schiller (SS) tetrapeptide family, the KLA peptide, and mitochondrial-penetrating peptides (MPP), etc. These molecules share common properties of lipophilicity and positive charge. Through various technological modifications, they are conjugated to nanocarriers, enabling targeted drug delivery to mitochondria. Therapeutic interventions targeting mitochondria offer a hopeful direction for OA treatment. In the future, mitochondria-targeted therapy is anticipated to improve the well-being of life for the majority of OA patients.

The specific regulatory roles and interactions of IL-36γ and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in this disease remain largely unclarified. Additionally, the influence of miR-204-5p on the expression and anti-inflammatory functions of IL-36γ and PEDF in CA keratitis is insufficiently explored. Therefore, research focused on understanding the disease’s pathogenesis and immune regulation. Human corneal epithelial cells treated with heat-killed CA showed anti-inflammatory responses from IL36γ and PEDF, confirmed via western blot, PCR, and ELISA. Transfection of small interfering RNA and recombinant protein granules showed PEDF exerts immunoprotected regulatory mechanisms by inhibiting NF-κB via PPARγ. Analysis of multiple miRNA target gene prediction databases and literature revealed that miR-204-5p is differentially expressed in fungal keratitis. PCR and dual luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miR-204-5p directly binds to PEDF mRNA, negatively regulating IL36γ and PEDF expression. Consequently, both PEDF and IL-36 γ exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in CA keratitis. PEDF may inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway through the PPAR γ pathway. In addition, miR-204-5p inhibits the mRNA expression of IL-36 γ and PEDF, exacerbating inflammation. This provides a theoretical basis for new methods and drug targets for the prevention and treatment of CA keratitis, and promotes the clinical application of IL-36 γ/PEDF. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014881774

Materials and methods: Sixty-seven tumors were divided into a growth group and a non-growth group. The volume doubling time (VDT) and mass doubling time (MDT) of the growth nodules were calculated. Immunohistochemical methods were used to detect the expression of Ki67, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, and CD163 in pulmonary nodules. The relationships between these immune markers and the growth of GGN-LUAD were explored. At VDT = 600 days, the growth nodules were divided into a fast-growth group and a slow-growth group. Results: The median VDT and MDT were 1059.3 and 947.9 days, respectively, for 49 growth GGN-LUAD. Compared with that in the non-growth group, the percentage of Ki67 positive cells in the growth group was significantly greater (p = 0.001). Among the 49 growth nodules, there was a significant correlation between CD3, Ki-67 and the VDT (p = 0.020; p = 0.003), and a significant negative correlation between Ki-67 and the MDT (p < 0.001). In the 32 pathologically proven growth invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) subgroups, a strong positive association between CD3 expression and VDT was discovered (p = 0.029), and a significant negative correlation between Ki-67 and MDT (p = 0.014). The CD3 of the slow-growth group was substantially higher than that of the fast-growth group (p = 0.034). Conclusion: This study preliminarily explored the relationships among Ki-67 expression, the molecular immune characteristics of lung adenocarcinoma and its growth course.

Although high expression of LTβR has been associated with poor patient prognosis and drug resistance, conflicting evidence suggested that LTβR induces apoptosis. To investigate the functional role of LTβR in tumors, we performed LTβR knockdown in cancer cells. We found that LTβR knockdown induced senescence phenomena such as reduced cell number; increased cell size; increased SA-β-Gal activity; and upregulated p53, MDM2 and p21 expression. Moreover, LTβR knockdown induced p21-mediated senescence in p53 WT cancer cells, but not in p53 mutant cancer cells. The level of p53 is regulated by MDM2 and MDMX; MDMX enhances MDM2 activity but is also subject to MDM2-mediated degradation in the nucleus. We found that the intracellular domain of LTβR bound to MDMX thereby inhibited its nuclear translocation, which in turn reduced MDMX ubiquitination and consequently promoted p53 ubiquitination. Additionally, tumors derived from B16F10LTβR-KO cells in WT mice exhibited significantly reduced growth compared to those derived from B16F10WT cells. These results demonstrate that LTβR regulates p53 protein levels by modulating MDMX stability and localization, resulting in p53-mediated cellular senescence.

Through systematic investigation of m6A epitranscriptomic remodeling during myogenesis, we demonstrate that METTL3-mediated m6As orchestrates myoblast fusion processes in both differentiation and regeneration contexts. Notably, we observed marked induction of Mettl3 expression post-injury, accompanied by substantial transcriptomic alterations in myogenesis-related pathways. High-resolution m6A mapping revealed distinct dynamic patterns of METTL3-regulated m6As during differentiation, exhibiting dichotomous regulation across target transcripts. Mechanistically, we identified myogenic fusion factors Mymx and Mymk as direct targets of METTL3, showing concomitant upregulation of both transcript abundance and m6A deposition during myogenesis.

However, the mechanisms underlying their developmental toxicity remain poorly understood. To address this, we applied an Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment (IATA) framework to evaluate the developmental toxicity of polystyrene (PS) MNPs by combining adverse outcome pathway (AOP) development, experimental testing within an Integrated Testing Strategy (ITS), and literature-based data integration. As part of the ITS, experimental evaluations were conducted using human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to assess PS MNP uptake, effects on germ layer differentiation, and size-dependent cytotoxicity. To further refine the assessment, an IATA approach was applied by integrating independent findings from the literature, strengthening the weight of evidence for AOP-based hazard evaluation. The alignment between ESC-based results and broader toxicological data enhances the predictive capacity of developmental toxicity assessments and supports the regulatory application of non-animal testing strategies. These findings contribute to the advancement of mechanism-based, human-relevant toxicity evaluation and provide a structured framework for assessing the developmental risks associated with emerging contaminants like MNPs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014847743

Methods: This multicenter, retrospective cohort study included 462 treatment-naïve patients (88.7 % female; mean age, 75.5 years; baseline BMD T-scores: lumbar spine [LS], −3.0; total hip [TH], −2.7) who initiated treatment with ROMO (n = 310), TPTD (n = 70), or DMAb (n = 82). Patients were stratified by baseline total PINP levels into low (≤ 70.1 μg/L) and high (> 70.1 μg/L) groups. After adjusting for baseline characteristics using inverse probability of treatment weighting, changes in BMD were evaluated at 12 months. Results: In the low PINP group, increases in LS BMD were similar between ROMO and TPTD; in the high PINP group, ROMO led to greater increases in LS BMD than TPTD. ROMO resulted in greater increases in TH BMD than TPTD, regardless of PINP level. Compared with DMAb, ROMO resulted in greater increases in LS BMD and TH BMD in the low PINP group, whereas no significant differences were observed in the high PINP group. Conclusion: ROMO demonstrated robust increases in both LS and TH BMD across all PINP levels. TPTD led to increases in LS BMD comparable to those with ROMO in the low PINP group. DMAb led to increases in both LS and TH BMD comparable to those with ROMO in the high PINP group. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014838559

However, an efficient method for expanding CECs remains inadequately established. Methods: We examined whether small molecule inhibitors of large tumor suppressor kinase (LATS) promote the proliferation of CECs. We also evaluated the expression of functional markers in CECs treated with the inhibitors. Results: We found that LATS kinase inhibitors enhance the cell density of bovine CECs ex vivo. CECs that were expanded in the presence of these inhibitors exhibited increased nuclear translocation of yes-associated protein (YAP) and upregulated expression of YAP-regulated genes. Furthermore, we observed that YAP was essential for promoting cell proliferation. Notably, the inhibitors also increased the density of primary human CECs. Expanded human CECs expressed CEC functional markers, including Na+/K+-transporting ATPase subunit alpha-1 (ATP1A1), Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and N-cadherin; they showed upregulated expression of YAP-regulated genes. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings support the development of efficient culture techniques for CEC expansion and may facilitate the advancement of therapeutic strategies for CEC-associated diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014816399

This modification exhibits dynamic elevation under ketogenic conditions including diabetic ketoacidosis, neonatal metabolic disorders, fasting, and sustained physical exertion, where circulating BHB concentrations exceed physiological thresholds. Emerging evidence positions Kbhb as a critical epigenetic-metabolic interface, with demonstrated regulatory roles spanning oncology, immunomodulation, cardiovascular homeostasis, neuropsychiatric disorders, circadian biology, and developmental processes. Mechanistically, Kbhb affects metabolic plasticity through modulating structural modification of key metabolic enzyme as well as metabolic flux. In addition, Kbhb exerts pleiotropic effects via competitive interplay with canonical PTMs (acetylation, methylation) at critical lysine residues. Kbhb-induced epigenomic reorganization through enhancer/promoter domain enrichment facilitates transcriptional activation of functional gene and mediates transcriptional network during the progression of multiple diseases. This review systematically examines the discovery timeline, enzymatic machinery governing Kbhb dynamics (writers/erasers/readers), molecular mechanisms underlying its pathophysiological functions, and therapeutic implications across disease states.

Brazilian experts in BC early detection attended a three-day meeting to discuss the challenges of SUS's existing early detection program and provide recommendations for surmounting them. The study identified that Brazil's current opportunistic BC screening model perpetuates issues with access to screening and regional disparities, while also generating low effectiveness and inefficiency. It also highlights several causes of delays in early diagnosis and treatment. The conclusions suggest an urgent need for an organized national BC screening program, in addition to the implementation of early diagnosis strategies, with multifaceted interventions, including urgent referral guidelines for suspected cases, training of key health professionals, patient navigation, and one-stop breast clinics.

This porous microsphere scaffold is implanted into bone defects to achieve the sustained release of hydrogen gas, magnesium ions (Mg2+), and dimethyl fumarate (DMF). DMF act by activating the nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 to prevent osteoblast pyroptosis, and combine with the antioxidant effects of hydrogen, effectively remodel the inflammatory microenvironment and create favorable conditions for the restoration of bone homeostasis. Mg2+ further expedite bone tissue repair. These results demonstrate that the GelMa/Mg/DMF MS effectively reverse inflammatory microenvironments both in vivo and in vitro, resulting in significant tissue repair. These results suggest the combination of hydrogen therapy and pyroptosis blockade as a potential therapeutic strategy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014808969

However, how it regulates metabolic reprogramming in sperm remains unclear. In this study, we show that succinylation of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) promotes oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and linear motility in boar sperm. Under low glucose (LG) extender, sperm linear motility was significantly enhanced, mitochondrial activity increased, glycolysis was inhibited, and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) was promoted. PKM2 interacted with voltage-dependent anion channel 3 (VDAC3), increasing mitochondrial permeability. Supplementing high glucose (HG) extender with succinic acid (SA) enhanced these effects. In contrast, the addition of resveratrol (RES) to LG extender, significantly reduced progressive motility (PM), decreased mitochondrial activity, and promoted the glycolysis pathway. Additionally, LG extender facilitated PKM2 succinylation and mitochondrial translocation. These findings demonstrate that PKM2 succinylation reprograms glucose metabolism from glycolysis to PPP, enhancing ATP production and supporting sustained linear motility, providing insights into optimizing sperm preservation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014806524

A key limitation is the restricted proliferation capacity of bovine mesenchymal stem cells (bMSCs), a widely used cell source in the field. Using a pooled, lentiviral CRISPR knockout screen, we interrogated 3000 CRISPR guides targeting 600 genes involved in stem cell regulation or proliferation. Notably, knockouts of TP53 and PTEN significantly increased proliferation rates and delayed senescence. Validation with individual gene knockouts confirms these effects, showing enhanced growth but reduced differentiation potential. We also identified chondrogenic differentiation as a promising target whose repression may further promote MSC expansion.

Accumulating evidence shows that senescent cells play a crucial role in the pathomechanism of diabetic wounds. In this study, we systematically evaluated the role of senescent cells in diabetic wound healing through diabetic mice (DM mice) model (including streptozotocin-induced type I DM mice model and db/db (type II DM) mice model, and actively assessed the therapeutic potential of ProcyanidinC1 (PCC1), the novel senolytic compound. We demonstrated that diabetic mice accumulated a significant number of senescent cells, primarily fibroblasts, in their normal skin and wound tissues. Local application of PCC1 selectively eliminated these senescent cells, leading to improved wound healing outcomes. By modulating the NF-κB signaling axis, PCC1 administration effectively downregulated senescence-associated secretory phenotype components, thereby ameliorating immune dysregulation in diabetic wounds. This therapeutic intervention concurrently revitalized the functional capacity of dermal fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells, while stimulating coordinated matrix deposition and architectural remodeling of the extracellular compartment. Furthermore, PCC1 treatment enhanced epidermal barrier function after healing, a crucial aspect of wound repair which is often impaired in diabetes. And we also found that PCC1 would improve wound healing at type II diabetic mouse. Collectively, our findings elucidate the complex detrimental roles of senescent cells in diabetic wound repair and establish PCC1-mediated senolytic clearance as a promising therapeutic intervention. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014799657

RDEB patients suffer from relentless mucocutaneous blisters that evolve into chronic wounds with inflammation and progressive fibrosis, which heavily impacts the disease course. RDEB-associated fibrosis is the result of a complex dialogue among different cell types, signalling pathways and epigenetic players that are still poorly characterized. The expression levels of over 750 mature microRNAs were investigated in primary fibroblasts from patients with RDEB (RDEB-FBs) and healthy donors using TaqMan Low-Density Arrays. Among deregulated molecules, only the miR-129-1-3p was down-regulated in RDEB-FBs. Therefore, the role of miR-129-1-3p in regulating the fibrotic features of RDEB-FBs was explored by biochemical and functional assays in cells transfected with a miR-129-1-3p mimic or a small interfering RNA specific for BAG3 (BAG cochaperone 3), a newly identified miR-129-1-3p target. BAG3 expression levels were significantly increased in RDEB-FBs grown under basal conditions and reduced in response to their transfection with a miR-129-1-3p mimic. In RDEB-FBs, the over-expression of miR-129-1-3p or BAG3 silencing markedly impaired cell contractility, a typical feature of activated/pro-fibrotic fibroblasts, decreased phospho-AKT (Ser473) levels, and reduced the ability to synthetize and deposit collagen in the extracellular matrix. Treatment of patients' fibroblasts with the AKT inhibitor perifosine (KRX-0401) recapitulated the effects observed with the mimic molecule of miR-129-1-3p and BAG3 silencing. Our results highlight the role of the miR-129-1-3p/BAG3/AKT axis in RDEB pathogenesis, complementing and expanding the knowledge on non-coding RNAs involved in fibrosis-related processes. Taken together, these findings may contribute to enlarge the toolkit of molecules and pathways that can be exploited as therapeutic targets in skin fibrosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014796121

Benzene is a confirmed human carcinogen, and its damage to HSPCs is a key event in benzene poisoning. However, whether the environmental dose of benzene is involved in HSPC damage by inducing cellular senescence has not been reported. Here, male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to benzene vapour for 12 weeks (0, 10, 50 ppm), and mouse hematopoietic progenitor cell line FDC-P1 was exposed to benzene metabolite 1,4-BQ for 24 h (0, 5, 10 μM). In vivo and in vitro models combined with single-cell RNA sequencing have shown that benzene and its metabolites caused senescence in whole bone marrow and hematopoietic progenitor cells. Proteomics showed that benzene exposure significantly up-regulated interferon regulatory factor 4 (Irf4) in the bone marrow. Irf4 inhibition alleviated cellular senescence and hematopoietic damage, suggesting that Irf4 is a key molecule in benzene-induced hematopoietic cell senescence. Mechanistically, benzene caused a decrease in branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in whole bone marrow, hematopoietic progenitor cells, and plasma, and an increase in the BCAA catabolic enzyme Bcat1, mitochondrial ROS, and Bckdh activity. Irf4 inhibition down-regulated Bcat1, alleviated mitochondrial oxidative stress-dependent Bckdh abnormality, and up-regulated BCAAs. BCAA supplementation effectively alleviated benzene-induced cellular senescence and hematopoietic damage. In conclusion, the study identified that Irf4 triggered benzene-induced hematopoietic progenitor cell senescence and hematopoietic damage by mitochondrial injury-induced excessive BCAA catabolism. This study provides new ideas on the molecular mechanism of benzene-induced hematopoietic damage from the perspective of metabolism and senescence. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014780188

CDH11 has demonstrated important functions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). In transcriptome expression studies, we observed that Cadherin 6 (CDH6) expression was higher in RA compared to osteoarthritis (OA). CDH6 is associated with cancer progression, but little information is known on the role of CDH6 in RA. The present study investigates CDH6 expression, regulation, function in FLS, and distribution in RA synovia. Methods: Synovial tissue and FLS were obtained from RA or OA patients undergoing joint replacement. CDH6 epigenetic marks and expression in RA and OA FLS were evaluated using public databases. CDH6 expression was determined by RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunostaining. RA and OA FLS were stimulated with cytokines and growth factors, and CDH6 mRNA expression was determined. CDH6 was silenced using siRNA, and the effect on migration, cell growth, apoptosis, autophagy, cell cycle, and signaling was studied. Results: In our analysis of cadherin family expression, CDH6 expression was higher in RA than OA FLS. This was associated with differential chromatin accessibility and histone marks in the CDH6 promoter of RA FLS. H3K27ac was identified as an important regulator of CDH6 expression in RA FLS based on experiments using histone deacetylase inhibitors. TGFß, but not IL-1β, TNF, IL-17A, IFNγ, IL-6, or PDGF, increased CDH6 expression of cultured RA FLS. CDH6 knockdown significantly decreased RA FLS migration and cell growth. The latter was associated with increased apoptosis in CDH6 deficient FLS. Immunofluorescence showed CDH6 protein distribution in the membrane, perinuclear, and nuclear regions of cultured FLS. In RA synovial tissue, CDH6 expression was noted in FLS and macrophages within the lining and sublining regions. Conclusions: CDH6 expression is elevated in RA FLS due to epigenetic and local conditions of synovitis promoting migration, survival and cell growth, which are characteristic features of aggressive RA FLS. The intracellular distribution suggests additional functions beyond adhesion and homotypic aggregation, such as signaling and gene regulation. These data suggest CDH6 contributes to RA pathogenesis by influencing pathologic FLS behavior and could be a therapeutic target. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014760540

The inherent temperature-sensitive property of tumors positions magnetic hyperthermia (MH) as an increasingly significant area in non-pharmacological cancer treatments. However, the temperature threshold for tumor ablation often causes tissue damage and bone homeostasis imbalance. Therefore, development of moderate MH for OS, capable of achieving tumor ablation while concurrently restoring bone homeostasis, offers significant potential for addressing this challenge. This study integrates magnetothermal nanoparticles with defined temperature thresholds and borosilicate bioactive glass (BSG) to create an injectable magnetothermal bioactive system that allows for regulation of MH temperature. The ionic and alkaline microenvironment from BSG degradation primarily impairs the malignant behavior of OS cells by activating the TNF signaling pathway. This sickening effect diminishes the hyperthermia tolerance of OS cells, thereby boosting apoptosis of OS cells, even in the presence of the limited anti-tumor effects of moderate MH. Furthermore, the combination of moderate MH and BSG also promotes optimal bone formation by stimulating human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) via calcium and JAK-STAT3 signaling pathways. Collectively, this flourishes the therapeutic approaches and theories for the prevention and management of clinically refractory bone tumors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014756487

Methods: Senescent JBMMSCs were treated with UCMSC-Exos, and their effects on cellular senescence, proliferation, migration, and osteogenic capability were assessed using senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, CCK8 assays, scratch assays, alizarin red S staining, alkaline phosphatase staining, RT-qPCR, ELISA and western blotting. The underlying mechanisms were explored through western blot analysis of autophagy markers and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

Results: UCMSC-Exos treatment markedly attenuated cellular senescence in JBMMSCs, as demonstrated by decreased SA-β-gal-positive cells and downregulation of key senescence-associated proteins (p53, p21, and p16) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α). The exosome-treated cells showed significant improvements in proliferative capacity, migratory ability, and osteogenic differentiation potential compared to untreated controls. Mechanistically, UCMSC-Exos restored autophagy through modulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, as demonstrated by altered protein expression. In rat calvarial defect models, UCMSC-Exos treatment resulted in better bone repair in aged rats. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that UCMSC-Exos could rejuvenate senescent JBMMSCs by activating autophagy via the regulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and enhance bone repair in aged rats. UCMSC-Exos hold potential as a cell-free therapeutic tool for anti-aging treatments and regenerative medicine, particularly for age-related skeletal disorders. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014756368

This review classifies DAMPs into three major categories (protein-based, nucleic acid-based and mitochondria-derived) based on distinct molecular characteristics and biological functions, analyzing their structural features and functional differences. We systematically summarize current understanding of DAMP molecular transformation mechanisms, release pathways and recognition processes, with in-depth discussion of their pathological roles in major diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases and respiratory disorders. Particular emphasis is placed on the molecular recognition mechanisms between DAMPs and PRRs (TLRs, NLRs, CLRs and RAGE), and the disease regulatory networks formed by activated key signaling pathways (NF-κB, MAPK, inflammasomes and cGAS-STING). Current DAMP/PRR-targeted therapeutic strategies are comprehensively reviewed, including: modulating cell death pathways to reduce DAMP release, neutralizing DAMP activity using monoclonal antibodies, developing small-molecule inhibitors to block signaling pathways, and employing enzymatic degradation or gene silencing technologies for precise intervention. While showing promise in inflammatory and cancer disease models, these approaches face clinical translation challenges including DAMP molecular heterogeneity, inefficient drug delivery systems, and the complexity of multi-target synergistic mechanisms. Potential solutions involving nanoparticle delivery systems, AI-driven personalized treatment optimization and gene editing technologies are discussed. This review aims to provide references for developing novel therapeutics targeting the DAMP/PRR signaling axis, potentially opening new treatment avenues for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory disorders. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014755120

The aim of this study was to explore the protective effects and mechanisms of the probiotic Bacillus velezensis MZ09, which produces branched-chain short-chain fatty acids (BSCFAs), against the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in piglets. Results: In this study, a DSS-induced piglet colitis model was established to explore the impact of MZ09. Pretreatment with MZ09 significantly alleviated the symptoms of colitis in piglets. For example, the disease activity index (DAI) score decreased, the length of the colon was restored, and splenomegaly was alleviated. MZ09 enhanced intestinal barrier integrity by upregulating the expression of tight junction proteins such as Claudin-1, Occludin, and ZO-1. Using 16S rRNA analysis, we found that MZ09 could remodel the intestinal microbiota. MZ09 increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Firmicutes and Lactobacillus while suppressing the growth of harmful bacteria such as Proteobacteria and Escherichia-Shigella. MZ09 also increased the levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon. The increased SCFA content activated G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43), which increased the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and promoted the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). Mechanistically, MZ09 mitigated mitochondrial damage via the STAT3/hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) axis. This action inhibits nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis, thus reducing the release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Conclusions: B. velezensis MZ09 alleviates DSS-induced colitis in piglets through multiple pathways, including gut microbiota remodeling, SCFAs–GPR43–STAT3 axis activation, and NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis suppression. These findings provide a new theoretical basis for the development of targeted intervention strategies for IBD, suggesting that MZ09 represents a potentially promising therapeutic agent for IBD treatment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014749000

Herein, a hierarchical MgF<inf>2</inf>/polyurethane (PU)/pitavastatin (PTV) coating system is constructed on Mg-Zn-Mn BRS using elastomeric PU as an intermediate layer.

Methods: PT total flavone (PTF) was extracted from PT and identified the compounds by UHPLC-MS. Network pharmacology and molecular docking were used to predict the underlying targets and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of PTF. The prediction was validated in RAW264.7 macrophages. IL-1β and IL-18 in culture supernatants were analyzed by ELISA. The protein and gene expression were checked by western blotting and Real-time PCR, respectively. Intracellular ROS production was detected by DCFH-DA method. Intracellular lipids were analyzed by ELISA and Enzyme assay. The Caspase-1 activity was evaluated by bioluminescent method. Results: PTF was identified 47 flavonoid compounds, including typhaneoside (TYP). Network pharmacology and molecular docking indicated that the flavonoid compounds might regulate inflammatory response, fatty acid metabolism, and the NOD-like receptor, AMPK pathways. PTF and TYP inhibited palmitic acid (PA)-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in lipopolysaccharide-primed RAW264.7 macrophages, leading to decreased secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. Furthermore, PTF and TYP improved intracellular lipid metabolism in PA-induced macrophages, indicating decreased free fatty acid and triglyceride contents, reduced protein expression of CD36, PPARγ, FAS, DGAT1, and CPT-1, as well as declined ROS with increased ATP production. Additionally, PTF and TYP increased the p-AMPK/AMPK ratio and upstream p-LKB1/LKB ratio. Activated AMPK, in turn, ameliorated lipid metabolism dysfunction, thus abolishing PA-induced ROS production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Antioxidant and improving lipid metabolism by suppressing ACC also inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, respectively. Importantly, AMPK inhibition attenuated or abolished the inhibitory effects of PTF or TYP on ROS production, IL-1β and IL-18 secretion, and Caspase-1 activity. Conclusion: The findings highlight the ability of PTF and its active component TYP to inhibit PA-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages involving AMPK-mediated lipid metabolism, implying the potential use of PT flavonoid compounds as anti-diabetic inflammation lead compounds. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014728736

It results from brain damage in the cerebral motor cortex. The three types of CP are spastic, dyskinetic, and mixed forms. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stem or stromal cell therapy in children diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Main body of the abstract: A systematic search was conducted across four databases: PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase from inception to August 23, 2024, to identify studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of stem cell therapy for cerebral palsy. Data extraction was performed for all randomized controlled clinical studies. ROB2 (Risk of Bias Tool 2) was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. The main outcome measures were extracted from each study for meta-analysis, and a PRISMA flow diagram was used to illustrate the study selection process. Eventually, thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) is crucial for assessing motor function changes and evaluating the impact of stem cell therapy. Subgroup analysis of GMFM scores were conducted based on assessment time points (3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment), route of administration, and type of stem cell used. The results demonstrate that stem cell therapy remarkably improved GMFM score in the treatment group. For safety analysis, adverse events such as irritability, fever, nausea, and vomiting were assessed, and risk ratios (RRs) were calculated to confirm the safety of stem cell therapy. Conclusion: The findings suggest that stem cell transplantation was safe and effective for treating cerebral palsy. However, further high-quality RCTs with standardized protocols are necessary to investigate the efficacy of alternative stem cell types for cerebral palsy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014721470

Current treatments, such as mechanical debridement and adjunctive antimicrobial, work poorly; periodontal surgery brings pain and complications. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have a powerful ability to regulate immune responses and great potential for tissue regeneration, thus attracting extensive attention in the field of periodontal treatment. However, in the microenvironment of chronic periodontal inflammation, the therapeutic effect of MSCs is severely inhibited. Recent studies show that MSCs can transfer mitochondria to change energy metabolism, thereby regulating immune cell differentiation and function, lowering local immune responses. Therefore, this review proposes an innovative strategy of treating periodontitis using mitochondrial transfer by MSCs. It explores how mitochondrial transfer helps restore energy metabolism, reduce oxidative stress, and regulate immune cell function. This approach may reshape the immune-metabolic network in the periodontal microenvironment, reduce local chronic inflammation, and promote periodontal tissue regeneration. With the development of new technologies, treatments based on mitochondrial transfer from MSCs are expected to become more accurate and efficient in future clinical applications. In addition, this review introduces the “organ-immune-metabolism” three-dimensional regeneration model, which integrates organ repair, immune regulation, and metabolic reprogramming. We hope this review may offer new therapeutic insights for researchers in oral biology and periodontists treating periodontitis and other immune-related diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014718785

Recent advancements in regenerative medicine have highlighted the potential of exosomes, small extracellular vesicles, in mediating cellular communication and promoting rejuvenation processes in skin tissues. Exosomes are secreted by various cell types and are rich in bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, which are crucial for modulating physiological responses. Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), and other sources have shown promising results in enhancing skin cell proliferation and collagen synthesis and reducing oxidative stress, thereby mitigating both intrinsic and extrinsic skin ageing. Therefore, this review explores the mechanisms through which exosomes exert their effects, including the modulation of signalling pathways involved in cell growth, anti-inflammatory responses, and matrix remodelling. We also explore innovative delivery systems for exosome-based therapies, such as microneedling and hydrogels, which enhance the penetration and efficacy of these vesicles in skin applications. However, despite their potential, the clinical application of exosome-based therapies faces challenges such as scalability of production, standardization of purification methods, and understanding of long-term effects.

Unfolded protein response signaling is tightly integrated with bone cell differentiation and function, and chronic unfolded protein response activation has been identified in bone disease. The unfolded protein response has been found to promote oncogenesis and drug resistance, raising the possibility that unfolded protein response modulators may have activity as anti-cancer agents. Cancer-associated bone disease remains a major cause of morbidity for patients with multiple myeloma or bone-metastatic disease. Understanding the critical role of unfolded protein response signaling in cancer development and metastasis, as well as its role in bone homeostasis, may lead to novel mechanisms by which to target cancer-associated bone disease. In this review, we summarize the current research delineating the roles of the unfolded protein response in bone biology and pathophysiology, and furthermore, review unfolded protein response modulating agents in the contexts of cancer and cancer-associated bone disease. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014715616

This study aimed to investigate the impact of As exposure on spermatogonial senescence. GC-1 cells were exposed to NaAsO<inf>2</inf> (10 μM). RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling sequencing were performed to identify key regulators of cellular senescence. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation-qPCR was used to determine N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. The results revealed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in pathways related to cellular senescence. Several established senescence markers, β-galactosidase activity, γ-H2AX, and P16, were elevated in As-exposed GC-1 cells. Further analysis revealed that P21 and its transcription factor ETS2 were upregulated. ETS2 knockout prevented As-induced P21 upregulation and cell senescence. The multi-omics joint analysis indicated that As exposure elevated ETS2 translation efficiency by YTHDC2-dependent m6A modification. Mechanistically, As exposure induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate and RNA demethylase cofactor, was reduced in As-exposed GC-1 cells. Additional experiments showed that As exposure induced NAD+ depletion and suppressed SIRT3 activity. Supplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotide, an NAD+ precursor, attenuated As-evoked α-KG reduction and ETS2 upregulation. These findings suggest that As induces spermatogonial senescence via m6A modification-mediated upregulation of ETS2 translation and identify NAD+ replenishment as a potential countermeasure. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014652631

However, current models inadequately capture its complex inter-organ communication. Here, we established novel, physiologically relevant senescent liver and bone organoid models using engineered bionic hydrogels combined with doxorubicin (DOX)-induced senescence. These models successfully recapitulated hallmark aging characteristics: bone organoids exhibited reduced mineralization accompanied by elevated senescence markers, and liver organoids demonstrated DNA damage along with structural deterioration. Notably, aged mouse serum effectively induced senescence in both organoid types, confirming the existence of systemic aging regulators. The platform demonstrated robust bidirectional crosstalk, with senescent liver organoid-conditioned medium potently driving degradation in bone organoids and senescent bone organoid-conditioned medium aggravating dysfunction in liver organoids. Mechanistically, we identified 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) as a novel hepatocyte-derived factor mediating liver-to-bone communication. 27-OHC not only induced bone organoids senescence but also synergized with DOX treatment to exacerbate bone loss, a finding corroborated by in vivo mouse studies that validated the relevance of our platform in the context of pathological damage.

This study investigated the therapeutic potential of exosomes derived from glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2)-overexpressing macrophages in osteoporosis, with specific focus on miR-378a-3p-mediated regulation of osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory signaling pathways. Methods: GLP-2 was overexpressed in mouse RAW264.7 cells. Exosomes were extracted and characterized. In vitro, effects on osteoclast differentiation were assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Differentially expressed miRNAs were screened via bioinformatics analysis. In vivo, an osteoporosis rat model was induced by bilateral ovariectomy. Histopathological evaluation of femoral tissue was performed via Hematoxylin-Eosin and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase staining. Bone microarchitecture, inflammatory cytokines, and signaling pathways were evaluated using micro-CT, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and western blotting. Moreover, miR-378a-3p antagonist was applied to investigate the role of miR-378a-3p in osteoporosis. Results: GLP-2-carrying exosomes inhibited osteoclast differentiation in vitro and improved bone microarchitecture in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis identified miR-378a-3p as a hub miRNA and miR-378a-3p was downregulated in osteoporosis. In vivo, GLP-2-carrying exosomes promoted miR-378a-3p level and inhibited osteoclast differentiation. MiR-378a-3p mimics inhibited the NF-κB/MAPK signaling, and the direct binding specificity between miR-378a-3p and TRAF6 was validated via dual-luciferase reporter assay. Mechanistically, GLP-2-carrying exosomes enhanced bone parameters, suppressed inflammation and NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway, which were reversed by miR-378a-3p antagonist. Conclusion: GLP-2-carrying exosomes showed promise in treating osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and modulating NF-κB/MAPK pathways via miR-378a-3p regulation.

Methods: From July 2019 to June 2024, 3,836 patients undergoing orthopedic surgery at a single Grade 3 Chinese hospital were retrospectively analyzed and divided into two equal groups, with or without CP (1,918 patients in each group). The effectiveness of CP was assessed by comparing surgical site infection (SSI) rates, pathogens, OR turnover times, and patient satisfaction. Statistical analyses included between-group comparisons and multivariate logistic regressions. Results: Baseline characteristics were balanced across groups (SMD < 0.1). Overall SSI rates were 2.1%, significantly lower in the CP group than in the Non-CP group (1.6% vs. 2.6%, P < 0.05), and translating to a 43% risk reduction (OR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.36–0.88, P < 0.05). Gram-positive bacterial infections notably decreased (OR 0.331, 95% CI: 0.093–0.959, P < 0.05). CP implementation also improved OR turnover times (95% CI: 0.504–0.839, P < 0.001) and patient satisfaction (95% CI: 1.038–2.301, P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in other nursing quality indicators. Conclusion: Standardized CPs are effective in significantly reducing the incidence of postoperative SSIs, particularly those caused by Gram-positive bacteria, thereby enhancing infection control.

On the other hand, preconditioning MSCs with inflammatory agents is a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic effects of these cells. Therefore, we performed various direct preconditioning regimens (IFN-γ, poly(I: C), LPS, and hypoxia) on clonal MSCs (cMSCs), and for indirect preconditioning regimens, the same regimens were applied to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMC-derived concentrated conditioned media (CCM) was transferred into cMSC cultures to mimic in vivo conditions to obtain cMSC-EVs with better immunomodulatory effects and then selected hypoxia-induced cMSC-EVs and their source cells to determine their influence on immune responses in multiple low-dose/Streptozotocin (MLD/STZ)-induced mouse model. Methods: Direct preconditioning regimens include four groups: IFN-γ (50 ng/ml), poly(I: C) (42.22 µg/ml), LPS (1 µg/ml), and hypoxia (1% oxygen). For indirect preconditioning, these regimens were applied to PBMCs, and PBMC-derived CCM was added to cMSC cultures. The resulting cMSC-CCM was assessed for the expression of anti-inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, and regenerative factors and its ability to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation. The isolated EVs from the most effective direct and indirect preconditioned cMSC-CCM groups and their source cells were transplanted in MLD/STZ-induced mouse models of T1D and followed for 73 days. Results: In vitro characterization revealed that direct and indirect hypoxia preconditioning were the most effective groups among the different preconditioning regimens. Therefore, four treatment groups, including direct hypoxia-induced cMSC-EVs (dH-MSC-EVs), indirect hypoxia-induced MSC-derived EVs (iH-MSC-EVs), and their cell sources (dH-MSCs and iH-MSCs), were selected for EV isolation and animal studies. The in vivo study revealed that the fasting blood glucose (FBG) trend decreased in the four treatment groups compared with the sham group. However, the effects of direct/indirect hypoxia on cMSC-EVs were associated with an increase in the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) in the serum of the MLD/STZ-induced mouse models compared with their parental cell counterparts. Indeed, iH-MSC-EVs attenuate immune responses in MLD/STZ-induced mouse models. Furthermore, compared with their source cells and dH-MSC-EVs, iH-MSC-EVs significantly reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) in the serum of the MLD/STZ-induced mouse models. Conclusion: Our results showed the effectiveness of direct/indirect hypoxia preconditioning for cMSCs to modulate immune responses in the MLD/STZ-induced mice model. This study demonstrated that the immunomodulatory potential of iH-MSC-EVs is significantly greater than that of dH-MSC-EVs and their source cells. Our results suggest iH-MSC-EVs, could be a potential option for modulating the immune response in T1D. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014622265

Methods: We used a mouse model with adrenocortical cell-specific deletion of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1α; P2H1Ad.Cortex), which results in sustained and systemic elevation of GC. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) populations were analyzed phenotypically and functionally. Transplantation assays assessed the regenerative capacity of HSCs. To determine the role of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling, bone marrow from GR-deficient or wild-type donors was transplanted into P2H1Ad.Cortex or wild-type (WT) recipients. Results: Chronic GC exposure in P2H1Ad.Cortex mice resulted in HSPC expansion and promoted HSC quiescence and metabolic restraint. Functionally, these HSCs showed enhanced regenerative capacity with superior donor chimerism upon transplantation. There was a marked increase in myeloid progenitors and their progeny, including monocytes and granulocytes. In contrast, B-cell development was significantly impaired, with a developmental block at the pre-pro-B-cell stage. Transplantation studies confirmed that these effects were dependent on GR signaling. Conclusions: Our study reveals a critical role for chronic GC–GR signaling in modulating HSC function, promoting myeloid output, and impairing B-cell development. The P2H1Ad.Cortex mouse model provides a valuable system to study the hematopoietic consequences of prolonged endogenous glucocorticoid exposure and may aid in understanding the hematologic complications of chronic GC therapy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014613078

Mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), which is often overexpressed in various diseases and plays a crucial role in regulating key pathways like p53, emerges as an exemplary candidate for therapeutic exploitation within the TPD realm, serving both as an intrinsic E3 ligase and as a direct protein of interest (POI). By harnessing MDM2’s inherent E3 ligase activity, PROTACs have been designed to efficiently degrade specific POIs, achieving substantial success in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Alternatively, PROTACs have been developed to directly target MDM2 itself, offering new approaches for therapeutic intervention. Recent research has yielded valuable strategies for optimizing MDM2-harnessing and MDM2-targeted PROTAC designs, concentrating on warhead selection of POI, linker length and composition optimization, and the choice among various E3 ligases and their corresponding recruiters.

Relapsed neuroblastomas, which often have mesenchymal features, have a poor prognosis and respond less to anticancer therapies, necessitating the development of novel treatment strategies. To identify novel treatment options, we analyzed the sensitivity of 91 pediatric cell models, including patient-derived tumoroid cultures, to a drug library of 76 anti-cancer drugs at clinically relevant concentrations. This included 24 three-dimensionally cultured neuroblastoma cell lines representing the range of mesenchymal to adrenergic subtypes. High-throughput ATP-based luminescence measurements were compared to high-content confocal imaging. With machine learning-supported imaging analysis, we focused on changes in the lysosomal compartment as a marker for therapy-induced senescence and assessed the basal lysosomal levels in a subset of untreated mesenchymal versus adrenergic cells. We correlated these findings with pathway activity signatures based on bulk RNA and scRNAseq. Comprehensive image-based synergy screens with spheroid cultures validated the combined effects of selected drugs on proliferation and cytotoxicity. Mesenchymal models presented high basal lysosomal levels correlating with senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and sphingolipid metabolism pathways. Chemotherapy treatment further increased lysosome numbers, indicative of therapy-induced senescence. Furthermore, the mesenchymal subtypes correlated with MAPK activity and sensitivity to MAPK pathway inhibitors. Lysosomal and SASP signaling is druggable by inhibitors of lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase (SLMi) or senolytics, including BCL2-family inhibitors. Especially the sequential combination of MEK inhibitors (MEKi) with BCL2-family inhibitors was the most effective on relapsed neuroblastoma cell lines. Gene expression analysis of 223 patient samples, drug sensitivity profiling of five patient-derived fresh tissue cultures, and in vivo zebrafish embryo neuroblastoma xenograft models confirmed these findings. Inhibition of MAPK signaling in combination with BCL2-family inhibitors is a novel treatment option for patients suffering from relapsed neuroblastomas.

While the current reported endometrial organoids demonstrate potential in remodeling endometrial functions, they often lack the complexity and physiological relevance of in vivo tissue. Here, we introduce a vascularized triple-cellular endometrial complex integrating endometrial epithelial organoids, stromal cells, and endothelial cells within a microfluidic chip with a composite hydrogel comprising Matrigel and fibrin. This novel endometrial complex exhibits robust growth and endometrial repair capabilities in an immunodeficient mouse model of endometrial damage, significantly improving pregnancy rates. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed bidirectional cellular paracrine crosstalk between epithelial, stromal, and endothelial cells in the vascularized endometrial complex. Endothelial cells secrete BMP6 and Galectin-9, which enhance mitochondrial function and promote epithelial cell proliferation. Conversely, epithelial and stromal cells secrete WNT7A and WNT5A, respectively, to stimulate angiogenesis and vascular network formation of endothelial cells. These findings reveal the paracrine interactions that underpin the superior regenerative properties of the vascularized triple-cellular endometrial complex, offering a potential therapeutic strategy for endometrial repair and a valuable in vitro model for endometrial pathophysiological studies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014606849

Although many studies had verified the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the clinical treatment of the related complications associated with T1DM, especially the DKD, by preserving the balances of immune micro-environment and so on. However, the immunomodulatory capabilities of MSCs are still controversial on the the efficacy of DKD treatment primarily due to the variations on the immune micro-environment, which could be modulated by a variety of elements, such as the vitamin D (VD). Otherwise, its underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Herein, the purpose of our study was to explore the synergistic effects of co-treatments with VD and MSCs in vivo and in vitro on the progression of DKD by attenuating the SIRT1-mediated pathways. Methods: Four-week-old male mice were fed with different VD diets for four weeks and established the T1DM models by administering the STZ (40 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection, which were then treated with BMSCs (bone MSCs) injection through the tail vein. After the euthanasia, the renal functions, pathological productors and VD metabolites were evaluated by the related biochemical indicators, flow cytometry analysis, staining techniques and immunofluorescence in the serum and/or renal tissues. Meanwhile, the mechanisms of SIRT1-mediated pathways underlying the amelioration of co-treatment with VD and MSCs on the renal injuries were examined by qRT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry assays, which were then verified by the MPC5 cells in vitro with SIRT1-specific knockdown and over-expression under the treatment of high glucose (HG). Results: Totally, co-treatments of VD and MSCs could more effectively ameliorate the disorders of glucose metabolism and renal injuries (KIM1, Podocin, ZEB1 and/or ZEB2) by boosting the concentrations of VD metabolites both in the STZ-induced T1DM mice models and MPC5 cells with HG treatment in vitro (P < 0.05). Moreover, the mechanism results indicated that co-treatments of VD and MSCs could improve the DKD such as the renal inflammation and fibrosis by attenuating the SIRT1 to inhibit the activation of TGFβ1/Smad pathways both in vivo and in vitro (P < 0.05). Furthermore, over-expression of SIRT1 could partly abolish the inflammation and fibrosis in vitro by attenuating the SIRT1-mediated TGFβ1/Smad3 pathways, which might be aggravated under the down-regulated expressions of SIRT1 in vitro (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings had detailed the mechanisms underlying the amelioration of VD and MSCs related SIRT1-mediated pathways agonist on the DKD-like pathology both in vivo and in vitro, which could highlight the important potential of SIRT1 as a promising therapeutic target for the progression of DKD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014604943

Methods: Neonatal DMD rats received intraperitoneal adipose-derived MSCs according to three schedules: early (postnatal days 1 and 14), continuous (days 1, 14, 28, and 42), or late (days 28 and 42). Wild-type rats and untreated DMD rats served as controls. Functional and histological outcomes were assessed on day 56. Results: Continuous administration significantly attenuated the decline in grip strength across ten consecutive measurements (− 11% vs. −37% in DMD controls), and also reduced serum creatine kinase levels and diaphragmatic fibrosis (p < 0.05). Early or late treatment alone showed limited benefit. GFP-labelled cells were rarely detected in muscle, indicating minimal engraftment and suggesting paracrine-mediated effects. Molecular profiling showed lower CDKN2A together with higher CDKN1A, IL-10, VEGF-A and IGF-1 in the continuous group, revealing an anti-senescence, pro-regenerative profile that paralleled the functional gains. Conclusion: Early and sustained MSC administration offers superior structural and functional protection in DMD rats, highlighting the importance of treatment timing in maximizing therapeutic efficacy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014604726

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been reported to be effective for refractory acute GVHD; however, whether FMT is effective for refractory chronic GVHD (cGVHD) remains unknown. Methods: To investigate the efficacy and safety of FMT for refractory cGVHD and the underlying mechanism, 12 patients with refractory cGVHD received FMT via colonoscopy, and the response was evaluated at 12 weeks after FMT. Results: Among the 12 patients who underwent FMT, 1 patient achieved a complete response, and 5 patients achieved a partial response. Patients with refractory cGVHD presented lower α diversity and higher abundance of Escherichia-Shigella andEnterobacteriaceae. FMT increased gut microbial diversity, increased the abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, and decreased the abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and Enterobacteriaceae in responder patients. Moreover, it increased SCFA levels in fecal samples from the responder group and promoted the expansion of peripheral CD4+CD127- regulatory T (Treg) cells. Colon pathological examination revealed that CD4+ T and CD19+ B cell infiltration decreased and that CD4+ Treg infiltration increased after FMT. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that FMT is feasible and deserves further investigation for use in patients with refractory cGVHD.

Thus, facilitating vascular regeneration and maintaining BSCB integrity are key therapeutic targets for functional recovery post-SCI. Methods: Ischemia-induced pathological alterations in spinal cord microvascular endothelial cells were modeled in vitro using oxygen–glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-exposed bEnd.3 cells to assess whether QCT protects endothelial cells and enhances their angiogenic capacity. Subsequently, motor function, histopathological morphology, vascular density, and BSCB integrity were evaluated in rats with SCI to examine the therapeutic efficacy of QCT. A network pharmacology approach was employed to predict the potential pharmacological mechanisms of QCT in the treatment of SCI, followed by experimental validation. Results: QCT enhanced survival, tube formation, and migration of bEnd.3 cells following OGD/R exposure in vitro. In the rat SCI model, QCT demonstrated beneficial effects on vascular regeneration and BSCB integrity, contributing to improved functional recovery. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was investigated to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Conclusions: These findings suggest that QCT can promote the regeneration of blood vessels in the injured spinal cord and protect the structure of the BSCB by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, thereby enhancing the neurological function of rats following SCI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014601935

Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to improve treatment outcomes. Previous studies have reported that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) secrete several soluble factors that modulate intracellular signaling pathways that are critical for the regulation of cancer cell function. The present study aimed to investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of conditioned media from chorion-derived human MSCs (CH-CM) and placenta-derived human MSCs (PL-CM) on the migration and invasion of human CCA cells. We found that both CH-CM and PL-CM suppress cell migration and invasion in three CCA cell lines (KKU100, KKU213A and KKU213B) by increasing E-cadherin expression and decreasing the expression of several factors involved in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition process, including ZEB1, ZEB2, N-cadherin, vimentin, and MMP-2. The effects of CH-CM and PL-CM were mediated, at least in part, through the suppression of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in CCA cells. Our findings suggest that soluble factors derived from CH-MSCs and PL-MSCs could be used in combination with other conventional treatments to diminish the invasiveness of CCA cells, thus improving the therapeutic outcome and increasing survival in CCA patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014599066

Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are recognized as pivotal mediators of MSCs’ paracrine activity and represent a novel therapeutic approach for IC/BPS. However, their efficacy is hindered by the inherent variability of primary MSCs (pMSCs) from different donors and their susceptibility to senescence during culture expansion. Methods: To overcome these challenges, we developed conditionally immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs) using a doxycycline-regulated simian virus 40 Large T expression system in pMSCs. The conditioned proliferation capacity of iMSCs was evaluated using cell counting and immunocytochemistry. The expression of surface markers on iMSCs was assessed by flow cytometry. The osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capabilities of iMSCs at different population doubling (PD) numbers were analyzed by qPCR, alizarin red staining, and oil red O staining. The EVs secreted by iMSCs were characterized using Western blot, scanning electron microscopy, and particle size analysis. In vitro and in vivo bladder inflammation models were used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of EVs on IC/BPS. Results: These iMSCs exhibited precisely controlled proliferation, maintained surface marker expression and differentiation capacities, comparable to pMSCs up to PD 40. The characteristics of iMSC-EVs are equivalent to those of pMSCs. Furthermore, in vitro cellular experiments demonstrate that iMSC-EVs provide protective effects against LPS/ATP-induced damage in SV-HUC-1 cells. Additionally, administration of iMSC-EVs significantly enhanced tissue healing and anti-inflammatory capabilities in an IC/BPS animal model. Conclusions: In summary, this approach produced a reliable source of functional MSCs and EVs, with iMSC-EVs demonstrating robust immunomodulatory properties and promoting tissue healing in IC/BPS. This method represents a promising alternative to pMSCs for IC/BPS therapy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014596635

Despite extensive research, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain incompletely understood, and no effective disease-modifying treatments are currently available. Emerging evidence implicates dysregulated β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau metabolism as key contributors to AD pathogenesis, with growing attention focused on the roles of autophagy and apoptosis in mediating neuronal vulnerability. The autophagy–lysosome pathway (ALP) is the principal intracellular degradation mechanism responsible for clearing misfolded and aggregated proteins, damaged organelles, and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Apoptosis, on the other hand, represents a tightly controlled form of programmed cell death that, when aberrantly activated, contributes to excessive neuronal loss and neuroinflammation. In this review, we comprehensively examine the complex interplay between autophagy and apoptosis in AD and highlight the regulatory roles of major signalling pathways, including PI3K/Akt/mTOR, AMPK, SIRT1, p38 MAPK, NLRP3/caspase-1, and PINK1/Parkin. We discuss how disruptions in these pathways alter autophagic flux, impair mitochondrial quality control, exacerbate Aβ and tau pathology, and amplify inflammatory responses. Special emphasis is placed on the dual role of these pathways in modulating both survival and death signals within neuronal cells. By integrating mechanistic insights across multiple signalling axes, this review underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting autophagy–apoptosis crosstalk to restore cellular homeostasis and mitigate neurodegeneration. Clarifying these mechanisms may provide a foundation for novel, pathway-specific interventions to slow or halt AD progression. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014596040

They capture and remove foreign pathogens and play a crucial role in tumor development. The formation and release of NETs are regulated by various factors in the tumor microenvironment, including signaling molecules, inflammatory factors, oxidative stress, and angiogenesis released by tumor cells. NETs interact with immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, collectively shaping its immune characteristics and participating in processes such as metabolic regulation of tumor cells, metastasis, thrombosis, and angiogenesis, all of which influence tumor progression. This review explores the multiple mechanisms by which NETs influence tumor progression, including their regulation of tumor cell proliferation and metastasis, alteration of the tumor microenvironment, effects on angiogenesis and immune escape, and potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. It aims to reveal the critical role of NETs in tumor biology and provide a theoretical basis for future research and clinical applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014594210

Here, we develop a theoretical framework to predict LAD morphology in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), whose differentiation potential depends on the stiffness of the microenvironment. Our model integrates chromatin-lamina interactions with histone modifications, revealing a bimodal distribution of chromatin-lamina affinity shaped by nuclear heterogeneities such as nuclear pores. We predict that contractility-driven translocation of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) enhances chromatin-lamina affinity, leading to LAD thickening on soft substrates—a prediction validated through imaging and functional perturbations.

Low-Intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) is a safe, non-invasive physical therapy method widely used in promoting fracture healing, soft tissue repair, and reducing inflammation. This study explored the improving effect of LIPUS on ovarian function in PCOS rat models induced by letrozole and a high-fat diet. The results showed that LIPUS could significantly reduce ovarian weight, improve estrous cycle disorder, decrease testosterone, inflammation and OS levels in vitro and in vivo. Also, the number of cystic follicles in LIPUS-treated rats decreased, while the number of corpora lutea increased, indicating improved follicular development. LIPUS intervention markedly downregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and the pro-apoptotic factor (BAX) in the ovaries of PCOS rats, while upregulating the expression level of the anti-apoptotic factor (BCL-2). Moreover, we also discovered that LIPUS significantly decreased NF-κB signaling pathway.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of osteoporosis on RCT risk and investigate their genetic associations. Using data from the UK Biobank (n = 457 871), cross-sectional analyses demonstrated that osteoporosis was significantly associated with an increased risk of RCTs (adjusted OR [95% CI] = 1.38 [1.25–1.52]). A longitudinal analysis of a subset of patients (n = 268 117) over 11 years revealed that osteoporosis increased the risk of RCTs (adjusted HR [95% CI] = 1.56 [1.29–1.87]), which is notably varied between sexes in sex-stratified analysis. Causal inference methods, including propensity score matching, inverse probability weighting, causal random forest and survival random forest models further confirmed the causal effect, both from cross-sectional and longitudinal perspectives. A colocalization analysis across multiple datasets identified six candidate loci, including the successfully replicated PKDCC rs12996954 variant, which may help explain the shared genetic basis between osteoporosis and RCTs. In conclusion, osteoporosis significantly increases the risk of RCTs, emphasizing the importance of osteoporosis management in preventing RCTs.

Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 (IGF2) is believed to maintain ovarian function, yet the mechanisms and specific roles of IGF2 in POI remain unclear. This study explores the roles of IGF2 and its binding protein PCBP2 in POI, with a particular focus on their effects on mitochondrial function in granulosa cells and ovarian function. Methods: A POI mouse model was induced by cyclophosphamide (CTX), and ovarian function and IGF2 levels were evaluated using ELISA, RT-qPCR, Western blot, and histology. Human granulosa cells (KGN) were treated with CTX. IGF2 and PCBP2 were overexpressed or knocked down, and CCCP (a mitochondrial uncoupling agent) was applied to evaluate their effects on apoptosis, mitochondrial function, and mitochondrial fission proteins. RIP and RNA pull down assays were utilized to verify the binding of PCBP2 to IGF2 mRNA and IGF2 mRNA stability was assessed using actinomycin D. To further investigate the therapeutic potential of PCBP2 in POI, PCBP2 was overexpressed in the animal model to evaluate its effects on ameliorating ovarian function in POI mice. Results: IGF2 expression was reduced in POI mouse ovaries, characterized by disrupted estrous cycles, hormonal imbalances, and decreased follicle numbers. IGF2 overexpression inhibited CTX-induced apoptosis in KGN cells, restored mitochondrial function, and downregulated mitochondrial fission proteins. These effects were reversed by CCCP pre-treatment. PCBP2 expression was downregulated in POI mice and CTX-treated KGN cells. PCBP2 stabilized IGF2 mRNA, thereby promoting its expression. Knocking down IGF2 reversed PCBP2's protective effects. In animal experiments, PCBP2 overexpression improved hormone levels, increased ovarian weight and follicle numbers, and significantly alleviated granulosa cell apoptosis and mitochondrial damage in POI mice. Conclusions: PCBP2 promoted IGF2 expression by stabilizing IGF2 mRNA, thereby inhibiting granulosa cell apoptosis, restoring mitochondrial function, and ameliorating ovarian function in POI mice.

Exercise training has been shown to alleviate HFD-induced muscle atrophy. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is involved in ferroptosis and various forms of muscle atrophy. This study aimed to investigate the role of STING in exercise training against HFD-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. Methods: In vivo, HFD-fed mice were subjected to exercise training and were intraperitoneally injected with the STING agonist diABZI or selective STING inhibitor C-176 for 8 weeks. In vitro, the differentiated C2C12 myotubes were treated with palmitic acid (PA), followed by interventions with Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), Erastin, diABZI or C-176. Grip strength test, body composition analysis, serum assay, histology analysis, dihydroethidium staining, transmission electron microscopy, myosin heavy chain staining, mitochondrial membrane potential, Western blot, and real-time quantitative PCR were performed. Results: In vivo, exercise training significantly reduced the mRNA and protein expression of STING and ameliorated skeletal muscle atrophy and lipid peroxidation associated ferroptosis in HFD-fed mice. The STING agonist diABZI blunted the alleviative effect of exercise training in HFD-induced skeletal muscle atrophy and ferroptosis. The selective STING inhibitor C-176 and exercise training synergistically alleviated HFD-induced skeletal muscle atrophy and ferroptosis. In vitro, the ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1 partially rescued PA-triggered C2C12 myotubes atrophy and ferroptosis, whereas the ferroptosis activator Erastin aggravated myotubes atrophy and ferroptosis. diABZI exacerbated PA-induced C2C12 myotubes atrophy and ferroptosis. Erastin impaired the ameliorative effect of C-176 in PA-induced C2C12 myotubes atrophy and ferroptosis. Conclusions: Exercise training effectively suppressed HFD-mediated upregulation of STING in skeletal muscle.

Increasing evidence shows that under physiological and pathological conditions, mitochondria can be secreted into the extracellular environment to regulate various biological responses, including cellular bioenergetics. Today, the therapeutic modality known as “mitochondrial transplantation” has emerged as a cutting-edge and highly promising intervention for the promotion of cell and tissue regeneration. This innovative approach entails the replacement of dysfunctional mitochondria in the recipient organism with healthy, functional exogenous mitochondria, thereby aiming to restore cellular function and promote tissue repair and recovery. Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of local or systemic administration of mitochondria on in vitro and in vivo models of brain diseases. We discuss the effect of mitochondrial transplantation in various brain diseases and highlight some critical issues. In this regard, we propose vesicles as a delivery system for both whole mitochondria and mitochondrial components to target cells in the central nervous system. Furthermore, the aim of this review is twofold: firstly, to emphasize the significance of brain mitochondrial transplantation, and secondly, to prompt the scientific community to consider the practical applications of brain mitochondrial transplantation. To this end, the text highlights the as yet unresolved issues and challenges that must be addressed and surmounted if this field is to progress.

Severe injuries to these muscles often lead to more devastating consequences than limb muscle injuries, resulting in the loss of critical functions such as mastication and eyelid closure, as well as facial aesthetic impairment. Therefore, the development of targeted repair strategies for craniofacial muscle injuries is crucial. In this study, we engineered an adipose-derived decellularized extracellular matrix (adECM) bioscaffold co-loaded with seed cells and bioactive factors. The seed cells were STIM1-overexpressing adipose-derived stem cells (STIM1-ASCs), which exhibit directed and highly efficient myogenic differentiation, addressing the low differentiation efficiency of conventional ASCs that limits muscle regeneration. The bioactive factor used was insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-2), which modulates the immune microenvironment by reprogramming mitochondrial energy metabolism to promote M2 macrophage polarization. These M2 macrophages further suppress fibroblast collagen deposition, alleviating muscle fibrosis, while simultaneously enhancing the myogenic differentiation of STIM1-ASCs and myotube formation. Together, the recellularized adECM bioscaffold harnesses these dual mechanisms (promoting functional muscle regeneration and anti-fibrotic repair) to significantly improve the recovery of volumetric muscle loss (VML) in the masseter. The development of this bifunctional bioscaffold offers a novel therapeutic strategy and theoretical foundation for treating severe craniofacial muscle injuries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014433966

The PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling pathway is critical for regulating angiogenesis, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix organization—key processes disrupted in diabetic wounds. Isovitexin, a natural flavonoid from plants like passionflower and Cannabis, exhibits well-documented antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its therapeutic potential and mechanistic action in diabetic wounds, particularly regarding multi-targeted regulation of angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and apoptosis within the complex wound microenvironment, remain unexplored. This study demonstrates that isovitexin accelerates diabetic wound healing. Using streptozotocin-induced diabetic rodent models and cell culture, we found isovitexin significantly promoted angiogenesis and vascular maturation, reduced oxidative damage and apoptosis, and improved collagen organization versus controls. Crucially, these effects were entirely abolished by the eNOS inhibitor L-NAME, confirming PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway specificity. Whereas previous studies have largely focused on single-pathway interventions for diabetic wounds, the concurrent modulation of angiogenesis, matrix remodeling, and apoptosis remains unexplored. Our study uniquely demonstrates that isovitexin activates the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway to synchronously enhance angiogenesis, promote collagen maturation, and inhibit apoptosis. This tripartite mechanism—uncovered for the first time—provides a novel therapeutic strategy to address the multifactorial pathology of diabetic wounds. Future research should prioritize clinical translation of these findings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014414189

Biomimetic nanocarriers have emerged as a transformative strategy to overcome these limitations by leveraging natural cell membranes for targeted drug delivery. This review critically examines the application of biomimetic nanocarriers as precision therapeutics for intestinal inflammation. We discuss key fabrication techniques including extrusion, sonication and microfluidics used to coat synthetic nanocarriers with membranes derived from several biological sources such as macrophages, neutrophils, platelets, stem cells and bacteria. These biomimetic coatings exploit inherent biological functions such as immune evasion, receptor-mediated binding to inflamed endothelium and responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. Preclinical studies demonstrate that biomimetic nanocarriers effectively suppress pro-inflammatory pathways like NF-κB, NLRP3, sequester cytokines, promote mucosal healing and restore gut microbiota balance while minimizing systemic toxicity. Despite promising outcomes in animal models, clinical translation faces hurdles in membrane isolation standardization, long-term biosafety, and regulatory alignment. Future advancements require interdisciplinary efforts to optimize pharmacokinetics, enhance tissue-specific targeting, and integrate personalized designs.

Epidemiological studies suggest that dietary fiber intake reduces CRC risk, with butyrate, a fermentation product of dietary fiber, showing promising anti-cancer properties. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we reveal that sodium butyrate (NaB) upregulates the long non-coding RNA LOH12CR2 in CRC cells, which is crucial for NaB's anti-tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. Our transcriptome sequencing and subsequent functional analyses demonstrate that LOH12CR2 mediates NaB's impact by inhibiting the mitotic regulator SPC24, which is overexpressed in CRC. Mechanistically, LOH12CR2 interacts with and stabilizes the m6A methyltransferase METTL14, enhancing m6A modification and subsequent degradation of SPC24 mRNA. We identify a novel LOH12CR2-METTL14-m6A regulatory axis in CRC, through which NaB exerts its anti-tumor effects by downregulating SPC24 post-transcriptionally, thereby suppressing tumor growth and progression. Our findings elucidate a new molecular pathway through which dietary fiber protects against CRC and highlight LOH12CR2 as a potential therapeutic target. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014299426

Butein, a natural chalcone flavonoid that possesses varied biological activity, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antiplatelet effects. This study aimed to evaluate the possible protective effects of Butein against 5-FU-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Male albino rats were divided into 4 Groups (of 7 animals each): control, 5-FU, and two Butein-pretreated Groups (50 and 100 mg/kg/day, orally for 14 days) each before a single intraperitoneal dose of 150 mg/kg 5-FU, which was injected on day 14. Serum liver enzymes (ALT and AST), cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, and NF-κB), oxidative stress markers (MDA and GSH), TNF-α gene expression, and protein levels of caspase-3 and NRF2 were evaluated. Histological assessments were also conducted. 5-FU significantly elevated serum ALT and AST levels, increased NF-κB, IL-6, MDA, and TNF-α expression, and decreased IL-10, GSH, and NRF2 levels (p < 0.05). Histological changes included sinusoidal dilation, congestion, and hepatocyte degeneration. Pre-treatment with Butein markedly attenuated these alterations, where both doses of Butein significantly reduced transaminases, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress markers while enhancing antioxidant defenses and anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels. Notably, the high dose of Butein restored NRF2 expression and reduced caspase-3 protein levels more effectively than the lower dose. Histologically, the high dose of Butein preserved normal hepatic architecture with minimal pathological changes. In conclusoin, Butein offers dose-dependent hepatoprotection against 5-FU-induced liver injury through the attenuation of oxidative stress, suppression of pro-inflammatory and apoptotic markers, and upregulation of antioxidant defenses; moreover, the histopathological evaluation further supported the biochemical and molecular findings, particularly at the 100 mg/kg/day, which preserved normal hepatic architecture and minimized cellular damage; and, thus support the prophylactic potentialof Butein in managing chemotherapeutic liver toxicity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014297149

Despite significant advancements in cancer diagnosis and treatment technologies, conventional therapies remain largely ineffective against this tumor, urgently necessitating breakthrough treatment strategies. This comprehensive review critically examines recent advances in targeting ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death mediated through reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and lipid membrane peroxidation, for therapeutic intervention in GBM. The key aspects analyzed encompass the unique molecular mechanisms that distinguish ferroptosis from apoptosis and necrosis, along with its regulatory networks in GBM. The analysis also explores the therapeutic potential of targeting critical ferroptosis pathways, including dysregulated iron metabolism, impaired antioxidant defenses, and abnormal lipid peroxidation. Additionally, it examines the synergistic effects and molecular basis of combining ferroptosis inducers with chemo-radiotherapy or immunotherapy. Finally, the study highlights innovative applications of nano-drug delivery technologies in overcoming blood-brain barrier (BBB) limitations and enhancing the precision of ferroptosis-targeted therapy. Notably, this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between ferroptosis regulation and the tumor immune microenvironment, highlighting a promising ‘ferroptosis-immunotherapy’ combination strategy with clinical translation potential for GBM treatment. While challenges persist regarding incomplete understanding of regulatory networks and nanocarrier biosafety issues, this review not only provides a theoretical framework for comprehending ferroptosis-mediated anti-GBM mechanisms but also outlines future research directions, including in-depth dissection of ferroptosis signaling hubs, development of intelligent nano-delivery systems, and establishment of preclinical safety evaluation protocols.

Immunotherapy has emerged as an efficacious treatment against CRC. However, it is hindered by the challenge of inadequate immunogenicity. In addition to exerting inhibitory effects on cancer cell activity, the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin (OXP) possesses the advantage of inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) through reactive oxygen species (ROS). Schisandrin A (SCHA) can augment ROS production stimulated by OXP in cancer cells and enhance the efficacy of ICD. Consequently, we developed a liposome formulation named FOS-lip that co-delivers SCHA and OXP to actively target CRC cells. The FOS-lip exhibited appropriate particle size, high drug loading capacity, and less than 5% hemolysis. Due to the pH sensitivity, both drugs were rapidly released under acidic conditions, providing a foundation for their therapeutic action. Furthermore, liposomes modified with active targeting moieties facilitated efficient internalization of drugs into cells. Through liposomal delivery, these two drugs synergistically inhibited tumor cells (CI < 1). FOS-lip significantly elevated ROS levels in tumor cells and importantly promoted the induction of ICD, leading to release/exposure of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and enhanced dendritic cell maturation. Therefore, this study presents a strategy to enhance the immunogenicity of CRC by addressing the issue of insufficient OXP-induced ICD and offers valuable insights for future research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014212444

Immunity-related GTPase family M member 1 (Irgm1) plays an essential role in affecting the production of intracellular ROS. To detect whether deletion of Irgm1 could suppress osteoclastogenesis through cellular redox regulation, we first evaluated whether the Irgm1 level was significantly elevated in mice bone marrow-derived monocytes/macrophages (BMDMs) from ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporosis mice. Moreover, bioinformatics network analysis was performed to identify Irgm1 as a key upregulated gene during osteoclast differentiation. Next, we found that macrophage-specific Irgm1 knockout (Irgm1-cKO, Lyz2-Cre; Irgm1flox/flox) in OVX mice resulted in slower bone loss compared with OVX mice from the control group (Irgm1flox/flox). We then demonstrated that loss of Irgm1 inhibited osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption function via suppressing ROS accumulation. Further mechanism revealed that Irgm1 could endogenously bind to kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and keep Keap1 from ubiquitination and degradation. In the absence of Irgm1, Keap1 was downregulated and causing nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to translocate to the nucleus, thereby activating the level of the antioxidant system to combat oxidative stress. Moreover, Irgm1 deficiency in RAW264.7 promoted osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) through inhibiting the M1 phenotype polarization. Taken together, our results revealed that loss of Irgm1 significantly alleviates OVX-induced bone loss, thus laying the foundation for exploring Irgm1 as a novel targeting approach for the treatment of osteoporosis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014210065

However, its role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains poorly understood. This study aims to clarify PIGU’s role and mechanisms in ESCC by analyzing its expression across pan-cancer datasets, clinical relevance in TCGA-ESCA samples, and effects on cell behavior (migration, invasion, proliferation) and signaling pathways, validated via immunohistochemistry. To examine cell behavior, we used Transwell, colony-formation, CCK-8, and wound-healing assays to assess migration, invasion, proliferation, and wound healing.The epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker levels were measured using Western blot analysis, and the cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed using flow cytometry in conjunction with western blotting. Furthermore, we used western blotting to examine proteins implicated in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.To further confirm PIGU’s role in ESCC progression, a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model was employed. Our findings suggest that PIGU is highly expressed in ESCC and is strongly associated with tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis and poor prognosis, and is an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients.PIGU knockdown not only arrested the cell cycle and induced apoptosis, but also significantly reduced migration, invasion, and proliferation in ESCC cells. Additionally, vimentin and N-cadherin were downregulated when PIGU expression was silenced, although E-cadherin expression was simultaneously increased.Moreover, PIGU knockdown decreased the amount of phosphorylated Akt and PI3K. In vivo, PIGU knockdown inhibited ESCC cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. These findings imply that targeting PIGU may represent a promising therapeutic approach, and that PIGU could potentially serve as both a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014200586

However, the regulatory role and function of histone lactylation in neurogenesis remain poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between lactate and the fate of neural stem cells (NSCs), and explore the role of histone lactylation in neurogenesis. Methods: Under hypoxic conditions, NSCs were treated with lactate to investigate its effects on cell fate. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were performed to detect histone lactylation modifications. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to characterize the transcriptome after lactate treatment, in conjunction with Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), to identify potential target genes for histone lactylation. Results: Under hypoxic conditions, L-lactate promotes neurogenesis and induces H3K9 histone lactylation (H3K9la). The inhibition of L-lactate uptake or production hinders neuronal development and is accompanied by decreased H3K9la. And the inhibition of H3K9la inhibits the differentiation of NSCs into neurons. Furthermore, H3K9la was enriched in the SnoN (also known as Skil) promoter region, and siRNA targeting SnoN inhibits the generation of Doublecortin (DCX)+ neurons. Conclusion: L-lactate promotes neurogenesis through H3K9la/SnoN axis under hypoxic environments and SnoN potentially serves as a novel target for enhancing neurological recovery in cerebral ischemia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014197063

This study investigated the characteristics of CAFs in glioblastoma (GBM) and developed a CAF-based risk signature to predict patient prognosis. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, whereas the bulk RNA-seq datasets were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), respectively. The Seurat R package processed scRNA-seq data to identify CAF clusters using established markers. Prognostic genes were screened through univariate Cox regression, with Lasso regression constructing the final risk model. A nomogram incorporating clinical parameters was subsequently developed. Immunohistochemical validation was performed using the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) for the signature genes. The qRT-PCR validation was conducted in U251 and HA cells. ScRNA-seq analysis revealed five CAF clusters in GBM, including three prognostically relevant subtypes. Three key genes were refined to construct a risk signature functionally enriched in the the IL6_JAK_STAT3 signaling, P53 pathway, and inflammatory response. The signature correlated strongly with stromal and immune scores. Multivariate analysis confirmed risk signature independent prognostic value (P < 0.0001), followed by age (P = 0.005). The CAF-derived nomogram demonstrated superior predictive accuracy for 1-/2-year survival compared to clinical factors alone. The signature genes were validated in the HPA database and experimental validation. This study proposes CAF-derived molecular signatures as potential predictors of glioblastoma prognosis worthy of clinical validation. Systematic characterization of CAF heterogeneity may offer insights for interpreting GBM immunotherapy responses, providing a foundation for future exploration of stroma-targeted therapeutic strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014192344

Therefore, in this study, a coupled aging test with immersion-ultraviolet irradiation cycles was designed to investigate the effects of thermal oxygen, ultraviolet irradiation and immersion conditions on the long-term aging process of O-Pal/SBS composite asphalt. The rheological properties, microstructure, modification mechanism and water stability of the composite-modified asphalt before and after aging were evaluated by DSR, FM, FTIR and SFE experiments, respectively. The results show that UV irradiation accelerates the physicochemical reactions on the surface of the asphalt film with immersion in water, acid rain and salt solution, which results in the rapid occurrence of different degrees of damage, such as roughening and cracking. Moreover, coupled aging treatments also have different degrees of negative effects on the high- and low-temperature performance, viscoelastic ratios and antifatigue properties of the asphalt during long-term aging. At the microstructural level, O-Pal at a content of 3 wt% can produce a stable crosslinked chain structure, addressing the problem in which asphalt molecular chains break and oxidize due to ultraviolet rays during long-term aging.

Studies have found that 5-HMF has many pharmacological effects, such as improving hemorheology, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant activity and anti-myocardial ischemia. Identifying the preventive effect of 5-HMF against ischemic stroke and its possible mechanism was the aim of this investigation. Methods: The MCAO animal model was used to detect the related indexes of behavior, neurological function and mitochondrial function, and to clarify the effect of 5-HMF on ischemic stroke. The HBMECs model induced by OGD-R was intervened by 5-HMF, and the GluR2 silencing sequence was added to detect mitochondrial function and angiogenesis-related indicators, so as to further explore the mechanism of 5-HMF intervention in ischemic stroke. Results: In the MCAO experiment, the behavioral results showed that 5-HMF increased the quantity of autonomic activities, increased the exercise time and distance, reduced the balance beam score, and prolonged the residence time of MCAO rats on the rotating rod (P < 0.01). The results of neurological function indicated that 5-HMF reduced the neurological function score, increased the blood flow velocity of middle cerebral artery (P < 0.01), reduced the area of cerebral infarction, and alleviated the damage of cerebral cortex and hippocampal neurons. The results of mitochondrial function indicated that 5-HMF could significantly reduce the apoptosis of primary brain cells, ROS, Ca2+ levels, increase mitochondrial membrane potential and GluR2 expression in MCAO rats (P < 0.01). In the OGD-R-induced HBMECs experiment, 5-HMF increased the expression level of GluR2, increased cell viability, and decreased LDH activity in cell supernatant (P < 0.01). The results of mitochondrial function showed that 5-HMF reduced the levels of Ca2+ and glutamate in the cell supernatant, reduced the levels of apoptosis and ROS, increased the mitochondrial membrane potential, and improved the expression of mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). These improvements were markedly reversed after the addition of GluR2 silencing sequence (P < 0.01). Conclusions: 5-HMF has the effect of ameliorating brain damage in MCAO rats, and by regulating the expression of GluR2, reducing intracellular Ca2+ concentration, improving mitochondrial function, promoting angiogenesis, thereby reducing OGD-R-induced HBMECs damage. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014186406

Given the wide variety of stem cell sources, there are inherent differences in their biological characteristics and functions. This article compares the efficacy of stem cells from different sources in the treatment of premature ovarian failure in an animal model, and provides a basis for their clinical application. Methods: A search was conducted for studies on stem cell therapy for POF animal models in PubMed, Cochrane Library, CBM, EMbase, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and the time limit for searching was from the date of the establishment of the respective databases to 2024-12-31. After screening the literature, two researchers independently extracted and analyzed the data. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the SYRCLE Animal Experimentation Risk of Bias Assessment Scale. The main outcome measures included estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone, and the number of follicles at each level. After assessing the risk of bias in the included studies, a network meta-analysis, plotting, and tabulation were performed using Stata 15.0 software. Results: Thirty-three animal studies involving 877 experimental mice were finally included. The overall quality of the literature was considered medium. The results suggest that four stem cell therapies——UC-MSCs, AD-MSCs, HuMenSCs and OGSCs, may be the four most efficacious in the treatment of POF; and UC-MSCs may show superior therapeutic advantage in increasing the number of follicles. When comparing transplantation routes, Tail Vein Injection and Intraovarian Injection may have higher efficacy compared to other routes of administration. Conclusions: This study systematically explores the therapeutic strategies for POF treatment using stem cell therapy. Further research is necessary to identify the optimal transplantation strategy and to advance both animal experiments and clinical research by improving and standardizing the design, implementation, and reporting of such studies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014181255

The present study aimed to evaluate the synergistic effect of a collagen-chitosan composite on bone fusion of the antebrachiocarpal joint in a rabbit model. Multislice CT morphometrical analysis was utilized to assess bone healing and fusion, offering detailed insights into the material’s efficacy in promoting joint stabilization and bone regeneration. Materials and methods: Twelve healthy male New Zealand White rabbits (4.0 ± 0.3 months old) with a mean body weight of 2.5 ± 0.5 kg were used. These animals underwent curettage of the articular cartilage down to the subchondral bone. The rabbits were then randomly assigned into two groups: a control group (C), in which no composite was applied, and a treatment group, in which collagen-chitosan scaffolds were utilized (Col/Cs). Joint fusion was postoperatively assessed using a multislice detector computed tomography (MSCT). Result: (MSCT) revealed progressive enhancements in the collagen–chitosan (Col/Cs) group over 12 weeks. Radial cortical thickness and bone mineral density (BMD) were significantly higher at week 12 in the Col/Cs group (1.31 ± 0.10 mm vs. 1.03 ± 0.18 mm; p = 0.0086, and ~ 760 HU vs. ~510 HU; p = 0.0055, respectively). Intra-articular mineral density (IATMD) increased markedly at week 1 (p < 0.0001), decreased at week 6 (p < 0.0001), and rose again by week 12 (p < 0.0001), while the control group showed a gradual, non-significant increase. Joint space width decreased significantly in the Col/Cs group by week 6 (~ 0.6 mm vs. ~0.9 mm; p = 0.0034) and remained lower at week 12 (~ 0.55 mm vs. ~0.7 mm; p = 0.0062). Fusion ratio reached ~ 65% in the Col/Cs group compared to ~ 35% in controls (p < 0.0001). CBMD decreased in both groups by week 1 postoperatively but recovered more effectively in the Col/Cs group. By week 12, CBMD was significantly higher in the Col/Cs group (~ 1000 HU) than in controls (~ 950 HU; P < 0.0006). (UBMD) was initially similar (~ 780 HU), but by week 1, the Col/Cs group maintained higher values (~ 760 HU vs. ~620 HU; p < 0.0001), and this inclination continued through week 12 (~ 750 HU vs. ~680 HU; p = 0.001). Conclusion: The results of the present study indicate that the collagen–chitosan composite enhances bone fusion and joint stability in a rabbit model of antebrachiocarpal arthrodesis, demonstrating both innovation and potential clinical applicability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014170498

Disruption of brain insulin pathways contributes to amyloid-beta accumulation, tau pathology, and neuroinflammation. These shared features have led to the concept of “Type 3 Diabetes” (T3D). This review aims to investigate the molecular links between insulin resistance and AD and to highlight emerging therapeutic strategies. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies published between January 2010 and July 2025. Search terms included “Diabetes Mellitus”, “Insulin Resistance”, “Alzheimer Disease”, “Nerve Degeneration”, “Cognitive Dysfunction”, and other related molecular and clinical keywords. After removing duplicates and applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 213 peer-reviewed articles were included in the final analysis. Results: Insulin resistance was consistently identified as a key pathological driver, impairing brain glucose uptake, amyloid-beta clearance, and tau phosphorylation. Disruption of insulin signaling pathways, especially PI3K/Akt and GLUT4 translocation, was associated with neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cognitive decline. Additionally, transcriptomic data highlighted the role of non-coding RNAs, including MEG3 and MALAT1, in modulating insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, linking metabolic imbalance to neuronal dysfunction. Conclusion: Insulin resistance and disrupted glucose metabolism play a central role in the development and progression of AD, supporting the concept of T3D. Targeting these pathways shows promising neuroprotective potential. Future studies should focus on validating these interventions in large-scale clinical trials. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014166399

Goldfish scales store calcium internally, which is released into the blood by osteoclast resorption. Previously, we found that melatonin increases calcitonin (CT), an osteoclast inhibitor, through melatonin receptors in goldfish scales, and inhibits osteoclast activity. However, the physiological function of the melatonin-dependent suppression of osteoclast activity is unclear. In this study, we found that plasma calcium levels increased during the reproductive stage in female goldfish and decreased during the post-reproductive stage. Histological and mRNA expression analyses of osteoclast marker molecules revealed that osteoclasts in the scales were inactivated during the late and post-reproduction stages when the expression of CT and its receptor increased in female goldfish scales. Moreover, exogenous melatonin suppressed plasma calcium levels in female goldfish during their late reproductive stage in cases of increased melatonin receptor expression. Taken together, these results suggest that melatonin inactivates scale osteoclast resorption by increasing CT levels in the scales and prevents calcium leakage from the body during the late and post-reproductive stages of female goldfish. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014162758

Here, we analyze bone marrow lipidomic data and reveal that BMAds deteriorate the skeletal microenvironment by secreting large amounts of lipids, altering the senescence status of neighboring cells by affecting their mitochondrial function. To specifically target BMAds under osteoporotic conditions, we design a polycation-loaded biomimetic dual-site framework (CZP@LC) that interferes with lipid crosstalk between BMAds and neighboring bone marrow cells. Shutting down abnormal lipid metabolism and secretion in adipocytes mitigates mitochondrial dysfunction in neighboring cells, which prevents bone marrow cells from senescing. The inhibition of lipid synthesis in BMAds blocks bone marrow stromal cells from differentiating into adipocytes, interrupting the vicious cycle. Moreover, interruption of lipid communication rescues osteoblasts from mitochondrial dysfunction-induced senescence and restores osteogenesis. Here we demonstrate the metabolic mechanisms of BMAds and lipid crosstalk in osteoporosis, provide a potential avenue for targeted biotherapy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014157180

Here, we report a novel pathway that modulates mitochondria dynamics in skeletal muscle involving the scaffolding protein ankyrin-B. Rare variants in ankyrin-B, encoded by ANK2, increase risk for cardio-metabolic syndrome in humans and mice. We show that mice selectively lacking skeletal muscle ankyrin-B have reduced endurance exercise capacity without alterations in muscle strength or systemic glucose regulation. Muscle fibers in these mice have increased oxidative stress, reduced fatty acid oxidation, and enlarged and hyperconnected mitochondria. We found that ankyrin-B interacts with and is required for efficient mitochondria recruitment of fission modulators and sarcoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria coupling. Thus, we conclude that ankyrin-B enables substrate adaptability and bioenergetic homeostasis under energetic stress, and exercise capacity by promoting efficient mitochondrial fission in skeletal muscle. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014153139

Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) acts as a critical defense mechanism for metabolic homeostasis, yet its implications in DM and its complications remain incompletely understood. This study thoroughly summarizes emerging evidence that delineates the molecular processes of MQC, with an emphasis on effector protein post-translational regulation, upstream signaling hubs, and interactions with other metabolic processes including ferroptosis and lipid metabolism. We highlight newly discovered processes involving mitochondrial-derived vesicles, licensed mitophagy, and mitocytosis that broaden the regulatory landscape of MQC, going beyond the traditionally recognized process including biogenesis, dynamics and mitophagy. MQC imbalance exacerbates insulin resistance, while impaired insulin signaling reciprocally compromises mitochondrial function, creating a vicious cycle of metabolic deterioration. Despite tissue-specific pathophysiology, diabetic complications exhibit identical MQC impairment including suppressed biogenesis, fission-fusion imbalance, and deficient mitophagy. Emerging therapies including clinical hypoglycemic agents and bioactive phytochemicals demonstrate therapeutic potential by restoring MQC. However, current strategies remain anchored to classical pathways, neglecting novel MQC mechanisms such as mitocytosis. Addressing this gap demands integration of cutting-edge MQC insights into drug discovery, particularly for compounds modulating upstream regulators. Future studies must prioritize mechanistic dissection of MQC novel targets and their translational relevance in halting metabolic collapse of diabetes progression. Since mitochondrial function is a cornerstone of metabolic restoration, synergizing precision MQC modulation with multi-target interventions, holds transformative potential for refine diabetic complications therapeutics.

However, MS-related lesions can distort structural measurements, potentially leading to inaccuracies in age prediction models. Lesion filling has been proposed as a corrective step, but its impact on brain age estimation and its associations with clinical and structural markers remains unclear. Methods: We analyzed 571 relapsing-remitting MS patients using the BrainAgeR pipeline to estimate brain age from both non-lesion-filled and lesion-filled T1-weighted images. Bias correction was applied to remove age-related prediction bias. Brain Age Gap (BAG) was computed as the difference between corrected predicted brain age and chronological age. Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess associations between BAG and clinical outcomes (EDSS, 9HPT, SDMT, 25FWT) and volumetric measures. Results: Non-lesion-filled and lesion-filled brain age estimates showed excellent agreement (r = 0.97; ICC = 0.962), with a mean difference of 1.23 years and slightly lower mean absolute error for lesion-filled predictions (8.12 vs. 9.40 years). Both BAG measures were significantly associated with EDSS, 9HPT, and SDMT, though effect sizes were modest. Lesion-filled BAG showed stronger and more consistent associations with gray matter, thalamic, and hippocampal volumes, and these associations remained significant after Bonferroni correction. Conclusion: Lesion filling modestly improves structural interpretability of brain age estimates in MS but has limited effect on clinical correlations. The high concordance between lesion-filled and non-lesion-filled estimates confirms the robustness of brain age as a biomarker, while supporting the use of lesion correction when structural precision is essential. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014142468

Additionally, histological examination via HE staining of the lung, liver, kidney, stomach, and thymus in the aged group at 6 months post-treatment revealed significant improvements in the structural integrity of these organs.These findings suggest that 18F -FDG PET texture analysis is a valuable tool for assessing the restoration of physiological function in aged rhesus monkeys following BMMSC treatment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014031594

Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP), rich in growth factors and cytokines, has emerged as a promising treatment to enhance ulcer healing. This study aimed to compare the clinical and histological efficacy of injected PRP versus topically applied PRP and traditional wound care in the management of DFUs. Methods: Sixty patients with DFUs were randomly assigned to three equal groups (n = 20 each). Group A received locally injected autologous PRP; Group B received topically applied autologous PRP; and Group C received standard wound care. All patients were followed twice weekly for 12 weeks or until complete healing. Skin biopsies were obtained at baseline and after 12 weeks (or upon completion for unhealed ulcers) for histopathological evaluation. Results: By the end of the 12-week follow-up, 87.5 % of patients treated with PRP (35 out of 40 in Groups A and B) achieved complete ulcer healing, compared to a significantly lower healing rate in the traditional care group (Group C). Histological findings supported the clinical outcomes. No significant difference was found between injected and topically applied PRP in terms of clinical effectiveness. Conclusion: PRP treatment, whether injected or topically applied, significantly enhances the healing of DFUs compared to traditional wound care. Both methods of PRP application demonstrated comparable clinical efficacy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014016995

Here, we report a dual-function trehalose strategy integrating its external and internal roles within LNP. This strategy enables trehalose to externally form a vitrified matrix that preserves LNP colloidal integrity, while internally stabilizing mRNA through hydrogen bonding, markedly reducing chemical degradation during storage compared to LNP relying solely on externally added trehalose. Crucially, co-loaded trehalose is co-delivered into cells, bridging the in vitro-in vivo gap by mitigating oxidative stress through reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) alongside elevated glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). This is corroborated by downregulated cytoplasmic and nuclear nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression.

Given the shared goals of stem cell therapy and rehabilitation, this study investigated the synergistic effects of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) transplantation in promoting motor recovery and elucidates the underlying mechanisms in HCP. Methods: The rats were allocated to a control group and HCP groups receiving different interventions (CIMT, hUC-MSCs or combination treatment), namely, the Control, HCP, HCP + CIMT, HCP + MSC, and HCP + CIMT + MSC groups. Motor function was evaluated using rotarod duration, grip strength, and forelimb suspension time. Golgi-Cox staining, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence staining, Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR and label-free proteomic quantification technology were used to measure dendritic/axonal area, myelin integrity, oligodendrocyte (OL)/oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC)-associated proteins and PRKCD/MEK/ERK expression in the motor cortex. Results: Rats in the HCP + CIMT + MSC group exhibited improved motor function, increased dendritic spines and branches, enhanced myelin integrity, higher numbers of Olig2+OL, CNPase+OL and MBP+OL, and reduced NG2+OPC counts in the motor cortex compared to the HCP group (p < 0.05). Additionally, motor performance in the HCP + CIMT + MSC group was significantly superior to than those in the HCP + CIMT and HCP + MSC groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, proteomic analysis identified that PRKCD, a key mediator of the synergistic effect, was expressed in OPC and implicated in their physiological processes. Rats in the HCP + CIMT + MSC group also showed reduced PRKCD protein and mRNA expression, fewer PRKCD+/NG2+ cells, higher CNPase+/PRKCD+ area ratio and lower levels of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation relative to the HCP group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: CIMT combined with hUC-MSCs transplantation synergistically promoted OPC differentiation into immature OL, induced myelination, and restored motor function in HCP rats, potentially by inhibiting the PRKCD/MEK/ERK pathway. This combined approach expands therapeutic options for HCP and identifies a promising target for future interventions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105014002588

It has been reported that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the development of AAA. In this study, our objective was to investigate the roles of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 14 (SNHG14) and the associated mechanisms in the development of AAA. An AAA mouse model was established by administering angiotensin II (Ang II). The expression of SNHG14 in abdominal aortic tissues was evaluated using in situ hybridization and reverse-transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The incidence of AAA and the maximal aortic diameter were analyzed. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, Elastica van Gieson staining, western blotting, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining, and immunofluorescence staining were performed to assess the in vivo effects of SNHG14. Human arterial smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) were treated with Ang II to simulate AAA-like conditions in vitro. RT-qPCR, flow cytometry, western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining were carried out. The molecular mechanisms of SNHG14 were also investigated through luciferase reporter assays, western blotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Our findings revealed that knockdown of SNHG14 inhibited the development of AAA and alleviated Ang II-induced pathological alterations and apoptosis in mice. Additionally, silencing of SNHG14 promoted autophagy in aortic tissues. For in vitro analysis, downregulation of SNHG14 inhibited apoptosis of HASMCs and promoted autophagy in vitro. Mechanistically, SNHG14 targeted miR-27b-3p, and inhibition of miR-27b-3p counteracted the protective effects of SNHG14 knockdown. Additionally, SNHG14 activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, c-Myc bound to the SNHG14 promoter and activated its transcription. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that overexpression of the lncRNA SNHG14 might exacerbate the formation of AAA by promoting apoptosis of HASMCs and inhibiting autophagy through the miR-27b-3p/Wnt/β-catenin/c-Myc axis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013998162

Excessive caloric intake promotes adiposity and dysregulation of metabolic signaling in adipose tissue. This study employed a mouse model of diet-induced obesity to evaluate the ability of cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabis-derived phytochemical, to mitigate metabolic dysfunction. Five-week-old mice received a standard diet or a high-fat diet (HF) with or without CBD (25 mg/kg bw) for 9 weeks. CBD supplementation reduced weight gain and lowered serum glucose concentration in HF mice. These improvements were accompanied by reduced white adipose tissue mass and smaller adipocyte size. Additionally, CBD treatment recovered protein levels of key metabolic regulators, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1 alpha and Sirtuin 1, in both inguinal and epididymal adipose tissues. Consistently, CBD supplementation upregulated the mRNA expression of Prdm16 and promoted uncoupling protein 1 at both mRNA and protein levels, showing the browning of adipose tissues. Upstream, CBD supplementation increased transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in HF mice at both the mRNA and protein levels, which possibly helped orchestrate the observed improvements. In summary, dietary CBD mitigates weight gain and improves the metabolic health of HF-challenged mice, potentially through the promotion of white adipose tissue browning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013994929

However, strategies targeting neurovascular regeneration remain limited. Here, we developed a sprayable hydrogel sponge based on gelatin methacryloyl and methacrylamide-modified ε-poly-L-lysine (S-GPL), co-functionalized with VEGF-mimetic peptide (KLT) and BDNF-mimetic peptide (RGI). The sprayable format conforms to irregular wound geometries, while the pneumatic spraying technique generates high-pressure microbubbles that create a porous structure, thereby enhancing exudate absorption and sustained peptide release as a sponge dressing. Additionally, the incorporation of KLT and RGI facilitates the reconstruction of the neurovascular microenvironment. In vitro, KLT promoted endothelial cell maturation and cytokine secretion, whereas RGI enhanced Schwann cell activity. Notably, S-GPLKLT/RGI facilitated intercellular interactions between RSCs and HUVECs, highlighting the cellular mechanisms underlying neurovascular communication. In a full-thickness diabetic wound model in rats, the hydrogel accelerated wound closure, re-epithelialization, and matrix remodeling. These effects were accompanied by enhanced neovascularization and axonal regeneration, along with the formation of a spatially organized neurovascular niche, as evidenced by CD31+ capillaries closely aligned with PGP9.5+ nerve fibers. Building upon the intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties of S-GPL, transcriptomic and immunohistochemical analyses further revealed that S-GPLKLT/RGI treatment suppressed the IL-17 signaling pathway. However, the relationship between immunomodulation and neurovascular reconstruction warrants further investigation. Collectively, this study presents a sprayable antibacterial hydrogel that not only reconstructs the neurovascular microenvironment but also mitigates chronic inflammation, offering a clinically translatable strategy for diabetic wound management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013994220

Current treatments such as vacuum sealing drainage, topical therapies, and autologous skin grafting are limited by issues like poor therapeutic efficacy, frequent dressing changes, and immune responses. Cell-based therapies have shown promise but are hindered by single-cell type limitations and hostile wound microenvironments. The stromal vascular fraction (SVF) has emerged as a potential solution, where the enzymatic digestion (E-SVF) contains various cell types, including adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, while mechanical digestion (M-SVF) introduces additional extracellular matrix (ECM), termed stromal vascular matrix (SVM). This review systematically evaluates the applications of SVF and SVM in wound healing. SVF promotes wound repair through proangiogenic, immunomodulatory, and ECM remodeling effects. When combined with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or biomaterials, its efficacy is further enhanced through the synergistic regulation of inflammation and angiogenesis. SVM, with preserved ECM, and SVM-conditioned medium (SVM-CM), rich in growth factors, demonstrate superior wound healing capabilities compared to conventional SVF. Despite the challenges posed by impaired viability and function of aged SVF-derived ADSCs and the low mechanical properties of SVM, emerging technologies, such as 3D cell cultures to enhance stemness and the integration of other biomaterials to improve mechanical strength, offer promising solutions. This review highlights the potential of SVF as an autologous, multifunctional strategy to address unmet needs in wound healing and provides insights into future clinical applications and research directions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013985139

As a proof of concept, these microparticles were incorporated into a sodium alginate derivative hydrogel to assess their ability to confer cell adhesion properties, making it more suitable as a support for 3D cell culture. The obtained results suggest that the addition of collagen microparticles does not significantly affect the viscoelastic properties of the hydrogels, as demonstrated by rheological studies and 3D printing experiments.

Previous studies have indicated that metabolic competition among microenvironmental cells regulates the function of immune cells. Recent research has shown that NAD+ metabolism plays a significant role in modulating immune cell activity, and increasing NAD+ levels is a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance the effector functions of immune cells. However, the regulatory mechanisms of NAD+ metabolism on the anti-tumor function of T cells in the OC microenvironment remain unclear. This study found that exogenous supplementation of NAM to increase NAD+ levels in T cells significantly activates the endogenous p-STING axis and downstream interferon signaling within T cells, thereby enhancing T cell activation and anti-tumor effects. Concurrently, we discovered that elevated NAD+ levels promote the retention of STING on the Golgi apparatus. Mechanistically, we elucidated that the increase in NAD+ levels mediated by NAM downregulates the expression of SURF4 protein through ubiquitination and degradation, subsequently activating the p-STING axis in T cells. Furthermore, exogenous NAM supplementation can further enhance the activation of the T cell STING axis by PARP inhibitor (PARPi)-treated OC cells, and the combination of PARPi and NAM significantly augments the anti-tumor function of T cells, inhibiting the progression of OC. Our findings provide a molecular basis for the regulation of T cell anti-tumor function by NAD+, highlighting the potential strategy of targeting T cell metabolic reprogramming for the treatment of OC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013967976

However, traditional administration methods are plagued by low efficiency, high systemic side effects, and poor patient tolerance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a targeted drug delivery system to enhance efficacy and reduce toxicity. Methods: A strain of Clostridium butyricum with anti-cancer properties was screened, and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) rich in sodium butyrate (NaB) were prepared. These OMVs (NaB-OMVs, NOMVs) were used to address the challenge of combined administration caused by differences in the administration methods and physicochemical properties of OXA and NaB. OXA was encapsulated into NOMVs via sonication to obtain OXA-loaded NaB-OMVs (OXA@NOMVs, ONOMVs). To improve stability and enable targeted delivery, a dissolving microneedle (MNs) system (ONOMVs@MNs) was developed using PVP K90 and sodium hyaluronate via the mold method. The system was characterized for morphology, size, zeta potential, mechanical strength, and rectal mucosa permeability. Additionally, targeted therapy advantages were evaluated using methods including anal microneedle administration in mice and fluorescence labeling of vesicles. Results: Characterization showed that ONOMVs exhibit a saucer-like morphology with a diameter of 100 nm and a zeta potential of 20 mV. The ONOMVs@MNs were conically shaped and possessed sufficient mechanical strength to penetrate the anal mucosa. In rectal mucosa permeability experiments, the 2-hour permeability of the MNs group was 1.78 times higher than that of the liquid (liquor) group. Anal microneedle administration in mice and fluorescence labeling confirmed the targeted therapy advantages of NOMVs@MNs. Conclusions: ONOMVs@MNs is an efficient local drug delivery platform that combines NaB and OXA, providing a potential therapeutic approach for RC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013893752

Irisolidone, a flavonoid from traditional Chinese medicine with a proven safety record, shows promise for bone health, though its role in osteoporotic fracture repair remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to investigate whether Irisolidone enhances osteoporotic fracture repair by promoting osteoblast differentiation through the activation of the AMPK-ULK1-autophagy pathway. RNA-Seq was employed to investigate the effects of Irisolidone on osteoblasts, revealing that Irisolidone enhances osteoblast differentiation by regulating autophagy-related pathways. These transcriptomic findings were validated in vitro using osteoblast cultures treated with Irisolidone, with autophagy and osteogenic markers confirmed through Western blot, qPCR, and immunofluorescence analysis. The role of autophagy in Irisolidone's effects was confirmed using Bafilomycin A1 and shAMPK transfection. In vivo, Irisolidone's impact on fracture healing was assessed in normal and osteoporotic mice through micro-CT, histology, and immunohistochemistry. Our findings show that Irisolidone accelerates fracture healing in both normal and osteoporotic mice by promoting osteoblast differentiation through the activation of the AMPK-ULK1-autophagy pathway. In vitro, Irisolidone enhanced osteoblast differentiation and autophagy, while in vivo, it increased bone mass and improved fracture healing, demonstrating its therapeutic potential for improving bone density and healing osteoporotic fractures. In summary, Irisolidone promotes osteoporotic fracture repair by enhancing osteoblast differentiation through the activation of the AMPK-ULK1-autophagy axis. These findings suggest that Irisolidone could serve as a promising therapeutic agent for osteoporotic fractures by leveraging autophagy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013889172

We find that receptor tyrosine kinase mutations are significantly more prevalent besides the widespread NAB2-STAT6 fusion and correlate with tumor grade. Transcriptomic analysis reveals four molecular subtypes—classical, neural-like, inflamed and migratory—each associated with distinct clinical and biological characteristics. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing identifies five tumor cell states, with the SFT_classical state serving as a precursor to other states influenced by hypoxia and inflammation.

Investigations into lncRNA-mediated pathways may provide novel biological targets for enhancing osseous regeneration and improving clinical outcomes. Aim: The focus of this study is to elucidate the role and molecular mechanism of lncRNA LINC01123 (LINC01123) dysregulation in the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts. Methods: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) determined LINC01123, miR-134-5p and XIAP levels in samples, alongside an assessment of osteogenic marker mRNA expression. The targeting relationships were verified by luciferase activity assay. The biological behavioural competence of the cells was assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, alizarin red staining assay, and western blot assay. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to analyse the potential of LINC01123 in the diagnosis of delayed fracture healing. Results: LINC01123 was overexpressed in patients experiencing delayed fractures and was sensitive in predicting the occurrence of delayed healing. As osteoblast differentiation progressed, the expression of LINC01123 and XIAP diminished, while the levels of miR-134-5p and ALP, OCN, RUNX2 mRNA were notably upregulated. Upregulation of LINC01123 reduced the levels of osteogenic biomarkers while suppressing cell viability and accelerating apoptosis, while miR-134-5p mimic partially reversed the inhibitory effect of LINC01123. Knockdown of XIAP partially mitigated the negative impact of silencing miR-134-5p on osteoblast differentiation and proliferation. Conclusion: Elevated LINC01123 expression promotes delayed fracture healing through the miR-134-5p/XIAP pathway, positioning it as a candidate prognostic marker for progression of fracture healing response.

The pores in the framework were subsequently occupied with nano-hydroxyapatite (HA), gelatin (G), and blueberry extract (BB) mixed with different ratios (guest). The physicochemical, mechanical, and biological behavior of the scaffolds were investigated. The results exhibited that all fabricated scaffolds degraded gradually as time progressed, with less than 20% degradation occurring within 56 days. The host-guest scaffolds favorably influenced the viability and attachment of MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro. Based on the MTT assay results, all scaffolds showed excellent cell viability, particularly HA10-BB40. Furthermore, the cell attachment increased on the surfaces of scaffolds with increasing HA and BB content. Specifically, high number of cells were observed on HA10-BB20 and HA10-BB40. Meanwhile, the best cell mineralization was detected in HA10-BB40 group. Additionally, the scratch assay also showed the ability of BB to enhance cell migration. According to these findings, HA10-BB40 was identified as the best scaffold composition and further analyzed for mechanical properties, wettability, apatite formation ability, and gene expression.

Hypoxia and immune regulation are pivotal in tumor biology. However, their combined effects and mechanisms in OS remain understudied. This study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of hypoxic-induced M2 macrophages in promoting the progression of OS. Methods: Differentially expressed proteins in hypoxic macrophage supernatants were detected by antibody array. Cell functional experiments, siRNA-mediated gene silencing, and overexpression transfection were used to study osteopontin (OPN) and its supernatant effect. Bioinformatics analysis was applied to investigate downstream targets and pathways, and a xenograft model was established to assess in vivo effects. Results: Our data revealed that hypoxic M2 macrophage supernatant enhanced OS malignancy and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, activating cancer pathways. Hypoxia upregulated OPN in M2 macrophages, and OPN inhibition reduced its tumor-promoting effect. Early growth response 3 (EGR3) was differentially expressed in OS cells treated with the supernatant, and its overexpression inhibited OS cell migration, reversing tumor promotion. Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), a key differentially expressed gene related to OPN and EGR3 overexpression, inhibited OS cell proliferation and migration. Additionally, OPN increased retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) expression and enhanced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, nuclear factor kappa B, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling, while EGR3 and ISG15 overexpression inhibited these effects. Silencing ISG15 restored pathway activation and reversed the inhibitory effect of EGR3 on OS cell migration. Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that EGR3 activates ISG15 transcription. OPN treatment upregulated DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression, and ChIP assays demonstrated that EGR3 overexpression enhanced DNMT1 binding to the EGR3 promoter. These findings suggest that OPN promotes OS malignancy by downregulating EGR3 and ISG15, and by enhancing RIG-I expression, as validated in a xenograft model of OS. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that hypoxic-induced M2 macrophages promote OS progression through OPN-dependent mechanisms, including inhibition of EGR3 and ISG15 expression and upregulation of RIG-I. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013878060

Ca2+ oscillations are known to encode important information in frequency and amplitude, ultimately controlling many cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. Previous studies evidenced that decreasing the frequency of Ca2 + oscillations by physical means can facilitate osteodifferentiation of MSCs. Understanding the relationships between Ca2 + oscillations and MSCs proliferation or differentiation appears necessary in the attractive perspective of influencing cell fate by controlling Ca2 + signaling. Methods: Using fluorescence microscopy we evaluated the evolution of Ca2+ oscillations throughout the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation processes. Then, using electrical stimulation with microsecond pulsed electric fields (µsPEFs), we manipulated the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in MSCs and measured its consequences on cell growth. Results: Although the evolution of the Ca2 + oscillation frequencies differed between the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation pathways in early stages of differentiation, we observed common features in the late stages: a progressive decrease in the Ca2 + oscillations frequencies, before their complete arrest as the differentiations reached their term. It has been reported that most cells undergoing differentiation experience a concomitant commitment to terminal differentiation and cell cycle exit, and prior to this, lengthened G1 phases, where the molecular competition between mitogenic and differentiating signals occurs. A relationship between the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations and the progression of the cell cycle, through some Ca2 + sensitive molecular factors, could explain the evolutions of the frequencies of Ca2+ oscillations observed during proliferation and differentiation. We hypothesized that increasing the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations would promote proliferation, while decreasing it would promote differentiation under differentiating conditions. Using electrical stimulation with µsPEFs, we manipulated the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in MSCs and its increase actually promoted cell proliferation. Conclusions: Manipulating the frequency of Ca2 + oscillations influences the cell fate of MSCs. We propose hypotheses on the actors that could link the Ca2 + oscillation frequencies with proliferation and differentiation processes, based on data available in the literature. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013874834

Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in OA, but its role in disease severity and associated symptoms remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in knee OA patients and its relationship with inflammatory markers and clinical symptoms. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 986 patients with knee OA over a 3.5-year period. Vitamin D levels, ESR, and platelet counts were assessed, along with demographic and clinical data. Statistical analyses were conducted to explore associations. Result: This study involved 986 patients with knee OA, majority of them (85%) were female with mean age 52.95 ± 12.44 years. More than half of patients 59.7% had unilateral knee OA and 40.3% had bilateral knee OA. The mean value of Vitamin D3 was 25.35 ± 14.125. Vitamin D deficiency was observed in 70.9% of patients, with moderate deficiency being most prevalent (36.94%). No significant association was found between vitamin D levels and inflammatory markers. However, a strong association was observed between vitamin D deficiency and symptoms like polyarthralgia (p <.05)., Bilateral OA was associated with higher vitamin D deficiency levels compared to unilateral OA (P <.001). Conclusion: OA more prevalence among female.As well as, vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in knee OA patients and its severity associated with Bilateral OA and polyarthralgia but not with inflammatory markers. Future research should focus on the long-term impact of vitamin D supplementation and the molecular mechanisms underlying these disparities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013873835

Methods: A cellular model of AMI was constructed by hypoxia-induced HUVECs. miRNAs that may interact with circ_0091761 were recognized by the ENCORI and circular RNA Interactom databases. RT-qPCR was performed to analyze the levels of circ_0091761 in AMI patients as well as miR-1278, ICAM1, and VCAM1 in hypoxia-induced HUVECs. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis. ROS kit and LDH kit were used to detect the levels of ROS and LDH, respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, RIP assay, and RNA pull-down assay were performed to validate their interaction between circ_0091761 and miR-1278. Results: circ_0091761 was elevated in AMI patients compared to healthy controls. Silencing circ_0091761 reduced apoptosis, ICAM1, and VCAM1 levels, as well as ROS and LDH. circ_0091761 could interact with miR-1278 and negatively regulate miR-1278 expression in hypoxia-induced HUVECs. At the same time, inhibiting miR-1278 reverses the protective effect of transfected si-circ_0091761 on HUVECs.

Osteoporosis poses a significant risk for rotator cuff tears (RCTs) and re-tears after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). Activating Leptin receptor (Lepr) mediated Stat3 signaling transduction facilitates the transcription of Runx2 and Sox9, respectively, and promotes osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. Materials and methods: Sixty-five female Sprague Dawley rats were used. Animal models—ovariectomy (OVX) and rotator cuff tear and repair (RC)—were employed to simulate typical tendon–bone healing and TBI reconstruction under deficient bone-forming capability. And, grip strength, transcriptome, ELISA, histochemistry, and qPCR were performed to reveal the distinct functional recovery between RC and OVX + RC rats, as well as pathophysiologic exhibition in the TBI at 2-week and 8-week. Results: RC rats exhibited better functional recovery during the proliferative phase of TBI reconstruction, i.e., 2-week, compared to OVX + RC rats, while both RC and OVX + RC rats showed a lower grip strength in the upper limbs during the remodeling phase, i.e., 8-week. In RCTs, where adipogenesis was suppressed in RCT healing, the osteoblast-derived Leptin (Lep) and Angiopoietin like 4 (Angptl4), the Lepr ligands, facilitate osteogenesis and chondrogenesis, resulting in an obvious mineralized band in the reconstructed TBI and a transit cartilage band during the proliferative phase in RC rats. In osteoporosis-comorbid RCTs, where osteogenesis was suppressed while adipogenesis was activated, the adipocyte-derived Lep and Angptl4, particularly Angptl4, facilitated Stat3 phosphorylation and nucleus transfer, Sox9 transcription, and chondrogenesis, which was observed in OVX + RC rats and led to excessive cartilage regeneration. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the role of Lep and Angptl4 in TBI reconstruction, via activating Lepr-mediated Stat3–Sox9 and Stat3–Runx2 signaling pathways, differentially regulating osteogenesis and chondrogenesis, and leading to the distinct clinical outcomes post-ARCR in RCTs and osteoporosis-comorbid RCTs. This study provides fundamental support for increasing Angptl4 in situ for chronogenesis in RCTs and lowering Angptl4 to Lep ratio for osteogenesis in RCTs with osteoporosis comorbidity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013869289

Pre-collagen type 1 N-terminal peptide (P1NP) is a key biomarker indicative of new bone formation. However, the relationship between PTH levels and P1NP levels in patients with osteoporotic fractures (OPFs) has not been fully elucidated. Methods: This study analyzed data from 588 OPFs patients hospitalized between January 2015 and March 2022. Serum P1NP concentration serve as the dependent variable, while PTH level serve as the exposure variable. Covariates included age, gender; Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), body mass index (BMI), lymphocyte, neutrophil, monocyte, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), platelet, triglyceride, albumin, hemoglobin. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess the independent association between PTH and P1NP levels, adjusting for covariates. Non-linear relationships were evaluated using generalized additive models. Results: This study found a positive association between PTH level and P1NP level in patients with OPFs (β = 0.59; 95% CI [confident interval] = 0.22 to 0.96; P = 0.0018). This association remained significant after multivariate adjustment. Moreover, the nonlinear model showed a threshold effect, with PTH level below 16.63 (pg/mL) being positively correlated with P1NP (β = 1.69; 95% CI = 0.90 to 2.47; P < 0.0001). However, this correlation did not hold true for PTH level above 16.63 (pg/mL) (β = 0.37; 95% CI = -0.34 to 1.07; P = 0.3091).

Methods: We performed Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) analysis to identify genes causally associated with HCC and intersected these with DNA damage repair (DDR) genes, leading to the identification of MRE11. A comprehensive evaluation of MRE11 expression in HCC was conducted using transcriptomic data analysis. We collected data from 92 HCC patient samples and validated MRE11 expression differences in HCC tissues through qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting. Publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and spatial transcriptomics were utilized to explore MRE11’s dynamic mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of both primary and post-immunotherapy cases. We also screened for differentially expressed genes and constructed a robust HCC prognosis model using 101 machine-learning algorithms. Results: Our results demonstrated that high MRE11 expression is strongly associated with poor prognosis in HCC. In the primary TME, MRE11 regulates immune responses, facilitating immune evasion. Single-cell analysis revealed significant tumor heterogeneity in MRE11 high-expression groups, particularly in macrophages and malignant cells, where MRE11 regulates immune evasion and tumor progression via the cGAS-STING pathway and HGF-MET axis. Under immunotherapy, high MRE11 expression facilitated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and extensive remodeling of the TME. Furthermore, MRE11 dynamically enhanced macrophage regulation, exhibiting immunosuppressive and tumor-invasive features. Finally, our prognostic model exhibited strong predictive accuracy across multiple datasets. Conclusion: High MRE11 expression is crucial in regulating the immune microenvironment in HCC, fostering immune evasion and driving tumor progression. MRE11 emerges as a promising biomarker for HCC diagnosis and a potential target for personalized immunotherapy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013866543

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have emerged as key regulators of CRC progression, but their specific contributions, particularly given their heterogeneity, are not fully elucidated. This study identifies podoplanin (PDPN), a transmembrane glycoprotein enriched in CAFs, as highly expressed in the CRC TME, in particular surrounding the tumor, and associated with macrophage infiltration and cancer progression. Methods: We performed mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis on matched CRC and adjacent normal tissues from patients to identify altered signaling pathways and protein expression. The clinical relevance of PDPN expression was evaluated in CRC samples from two independent cohorts using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis. Publicly available data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were analyzed to assess the association between PDPN expression and patient survival. Functional assays using direct and indirect co-culture systems investigated the influence of macrophage infiltration on stromal PDPN expression and its effect on colon adenocarcinoma cell growth. Results: PDPN expression was significantly elevated in the stroma of the colorectal tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and correlated with M2-like macrophage infiltration. High PDPN expression was associated with reduced relapse-free survival in CRC patients. Stromal cells pre-conditioned with M2-like macrophages upregulated PDPN and more effectively supported the growth of three colon adenocarcinoma cell lines. PDPN depletion impaired the ability of stromal cells to promote tumor cell proliferation. Mechanistically, M2-like macrophage pre-conditioning induced a TGF-β1–dependent increase in YAP/TAZ nuclear localization, RhoA/ROCK/myosin-driven cytoskeletal contractility, and extracellular matrix (ECM) production in stromal cells. Inhibition of TGF-β1 signaling or ROCK activity reduced stromal support for cancer cell growth. Conclusion: This study reveals a novel mechanism by which the TME facilitates CRC progression and highlights PDPN as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in CRC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013866202

This study aimed to investigate the effects of Hypericin (Hyp) on the hearts of rats with myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) and its underlying mechanisms. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats and H9C2 cells underwent MIRI and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) modelling after Hyp administration to assess the compound's effects on cardiac and cardiomyocyte characteristics, as well as mitochondrial energy metabolism. A range of techniques, including 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, haematoxylin-eosin staining, echocardiography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative proteomics analysis, molecular docking, and Western blotting were employed to further characterize Hyp's cardioprotective effects and its influence on related molecular expressions. TUNEL staining and Western blotting were also used to examine the morphological, molecular, and functional phenotypes of H/R-treated cardiomyocytes. Results: Hyp significantly reduced myocardial infarct size and improved cardiac function in MIRI rats. Hyp increased cardiomyocyte viability while decreasing cardiomyocyte damage. The cardioprotective effects of Hyp were primarily mediated by alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, mainly through the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) signalling pathway.

This study investigates how HEP14, a PKC pathway activator, boosts the regenerative potential of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) for ovarian regeneration. Transcriptome analysis reveals that HEP14 modulates gene expression profile in hADSCs, enhancing their regenerative capacity. In mouse models of POI and ARNA-OI, co-administration of HEP14-empowered hADSCs (h-hADSCs) with HEP14/PLGA microspheres significantly improves ovarian regeneration and function. These effects are attributed to increased h-hADSC retention and transdifferentiation, enhanced antifibrotic and proangiogenic capability, along with an optimized dosing strategy. The upregulation of MMP1, PDGFD, and STC1 through the HEP14-activated PKC-ERK1/2 signaling pathway is crucial for these effects. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of h-hADSCs and the HEP14-activated PKC-ERK1/2 pathway in ovarian regeneration and provide a promising advancement in treating ovarian insufficiency.

Investigating early, subtle cellular responses may be the key to optimize therapeutic outcomes and understand the biological effects of photobiomodulation. This study aimed to assess short-term macromolecular alterations in adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) subjected to 671 nm low-level laser irradiation via Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. ADSCs were divided into control, 1-hour (1 H post-L) and 3-hour (3 H post-L) post-irradiation groups. 671 nm low-level laser irradiation was applied at a fluency of 25 J/cm2. After 1 and 3 h, cells were collected and placed on the ATR unit of the FTIR spectrophotometer, dried under mild nitrogen flow and analyzed. Photobiomodulation resulted in explicit differences in FTIR spectra of 1 H and 3 H post-L groups, including alterations in lipid composition, protein secondary structure, protein phosphorylation together with changes in metabolic turnover of carbohydrates over time. Additionally, the membrane order decreased and fluidity increased in the 1 H post-L group, suggesting a temporary lateral phase separation in ADSC membranes. Photobiomodulation induced short-term structural and compositional alterations in biomolecules of ADSCs, which is further remarkable to provide insights into its action mechanism. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013856379

Emerging evidence suggests that exosomes from diverse cellular sources possess therapeutic potential for alopecia. However, research on the application of platelet-rich plasma-derived exosomes (PRP-exos) in promoting hair growth is still relatively sparse. This study aims to elucidate the effects of PRP-exos on hair growth and to investigate the associated molecular mechanisms. Methods: We employed conventional molecular biology techniques to evaluate the impacts of PRP-exos on hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) in terms of proliferation, apoptosis, and migration, as well as their protective effects against oxidative stress. A murine model of alopecia was utilized, and the effectiveness of subcutaneously administered PRP-exos on hair growth was assessed through histological analysis. Additionally, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was conducted to explore the potential pathways mediating the effects of PRP-exos on hair growth. Results: Our results demonstrate that PRP-exos significantly enhance both the proliferation and migration of HFSCs while concurrently inhibiting apoptosis and mitigating oxidative stress-induced damage. The subcutaneous injection of PRP-exos fostered hair regeneration in mice, marked by an increase in hair follicle counts of the anagen phase and dermal thickening. Importantly, we found that treatment with PRP-exos upregulated the expression of SIRT1, leading to the deacetylation of FoxO3a and a subsequent reduction in oxidative stress effects. Conclusions: Ultimately, our findings suggest that PRP-exos facilitate hair regeneration by modulating the SIRT1/FoxO3a pathway, providing more evidence for their clinical application in alopecia management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013853512

To elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying nerve regeneration, we performed single−cell RNA sequencing (scRNA−seq) on rat sciatic nerve tissues at seven time points (Days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14) following transection injury. Through unsupervised clustering, we identified four major cellular compartments—neurofibroblasts (NFs), glial cells (Glis), immune cells, and vascular cells—and delineated their dynamic trajectories during regeneration. Early responses were dominated by macrophage (Mac) and granulocyte infiltration (Day 1), followed by proliferative expansion of proliferating mesenchymal fibroblasts (NF5) and repair Schwann cells (Gli0) by Days 3–5. Vascular remodeling commenced from Day 7, while Glis progressively transitioned to mature myelinating states (Gli2/Gli5) by Day 14. Pseudotime analysis revealed subtype−specific reprogramming in both Macs and Glis, and cell–cell communication analysis uncovered key ligand–receptor interactions—particularly collagen and PTN signaling between Macs, NFs, and Glis. Bulk transcriptomic validation confirmed sustained and spatially distinct activation of the TGF− signaling pathway across cell types and anatomical locations. Comparative analysis with a sciatic nerve crush injury model revealed a stronger early immune response and delayed Gli recovery in transection injury, indicating a narrowed therapeutic window. Together, this work provides a time−resolved single−cell atlas of peripheral nerve regeneration, defines key regulatory circuits within the immune–NF–Gli axis, and identifies phase−specific therapeutic targets—such as early Mac heterogeneity, NF4−mediated matrix remodeling, and Schwann cell remyelination—for enhancing functional recovery following severe nerve injury. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013852012

Cisplatin, a highly effective and widely utilized anticancer drug, is particularly effective against solid tumors and serves as a cornerstone of adjuvant chemotherapy for lung cancer. Despite continuous optimization of cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens, the emergence of cisplatin resistance frequently results in treatment failure, significantly limiting its clinical utility and therapeutic efficacy. To address this challenge, researchers have extensively investigated the biological mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance, including impaired DNA repair pathways and inhibition of apoptosis. Among these mechanisms, epigenetic regulation—encompassing DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNA (ncRNA) regulation—has emerged as a critical factor in mediating cisplatin resistance by modulating gene expression and signaling pathways. This review comprehensively explores the role of epigenetic mechanisms in cisplatin resistance in lung cancer, highlighting recent research findings and their potential implications for developing strategies to overcome drug resistance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013851303

This review delineates eleven molecular hallmarks of immunosenescence, including genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation, which collectively drive immune cell dysfunction and systemic immunosuppression. Aging reshapes the tumor microenvironment (TME) through recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP), and metabolic reprogramming, contributing to therapy resistance and poor prognosis in elderly patients. While immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy (CAR-T) cells show promise, their efficacy in aging populations is limited by T cell exhaustion, myeloid bias, and altered intercellular communication. Emerging strategies—including senolytics, epigenetic modulators (e.g., histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor), and metabolic interventions (e.g., spermidine, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN))—highlight potential avenues to rejuvenate aged immunity. Single-cell multi-omics (single cell RNA-seq, single cell ATAC-seq) further unravel immune cell heterogeneity, revealing tissue-specific chromatin accessibility dynamics and novel targets like interleukin-34 (IL-34) for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. However, challenges persist in translating preclinical findings to clinical practice, necessitating age-tailored trials and biomarker-driven approaches. By integrating mechanistic insights with translational innovations, this review underscores the urgency of addressing immunosenescence to optimize cancer immunotherapy for aging populations, ultimately bridging the gap between aging biology and precision oncology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013847777

While the amyloid cascade hypothesis has long dominated AD research, emerging evidence suggests that neuroinflammation may play a more central role in disease onset and progression. Increasingly, AD is recognized as a multifactorial disorder influenced by systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation, shifting focus toward peripheral immune mechanisms as potential contributors to neurodegeneration. This review explores the hypothesis that inflammaging, the age-related increase in pro-inflammatory mediators, combined with lifelong exposure to infections, injuries, metabolic changes, and chronic diseases, among others, may prime the immune system, amplifying neuroinflammation and influencing the progression and exacerbation of AD pathology. To this end, we examined how systemic immune disturbances, including chronic pain, post-operative cognitive dysfunction, viral and bacterial infections, gut microbiome dysregulation, and cardiovascular disease, may act as risk factors for AD. Overall, evidence suggests that modulating peripheral inflammation, accompanied by early diagnosis, could significantly reduce the risk of developing AD. Furthermore, we highlight key immune signaling pathways involved in both central and peripheral immune responses, such as the NLRP3 inflammasome and TREM2, which represent promising therapeutic targets for modulating inflammation while preserving protective immune functions. Strategies aimed at reducing systemic inflammation, identifying early biomarkers, and intervening before significant neurodegeneration occurs may provide novel approaches to delay or prevent AD onset. In conclusion, this review underscores the crucial role of systemic inflammation in AD pathogenesis and progression. By targeting peripheral immune dysfunction, we may advance our understanding of AD mechanisms and develop more effective therapeutic interventions to mitigate disease risk and progression. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013845237
