Since the completion of our data synthesis, one scoping\nreview and one qualitative systematic review on related aspects of maternal immunization\nhighlighted women\u2019s need for clear information, ideally provided by their healthcare\nprofessionals, in a meaningful way that addresses identified barriers [75,76]. Governments,\nregulatory authorities, and HCPs have to collectively educate pregnant women about the\neffectiveness and safety of maternal vaccines and encourage vaccination when the benefits\noutweigh the risks [77]. Consistent and evidence-enabled recommendations from HCPs,\nwith mindfulness of the sociodemographic and cultural background of pregnant women,\nwould foster the acceptance of vaccination in pregnancy as an essential component of\nantenatal care. Global experience and lessons learned from the rollout of the COVID-19\nvaccination during the antenatal period provided valuable insights that can inform current\nand future approaches to optimise maternal vaccination strategies [30,78].\n5. Limitations\nThomson\u2019s 5A taxonomy is based on factors supported by evidential statements, and\nwe conducted this scoping review in a similar manner, examining each study for factors\ninfluencing or related to the maternal vaccine coverage landscape in Ireland. However,\ndue to the limited number of quantitative studies and study designs, the majority of\nfactors identified, while often supported by qualitative findings, do not represent statistical\nassociations with vaccine uptake. Additionally, unlike in a systematic review, no critical\nappraisal of the literature was conducted to determine the rigour and validity of the\nfindings, and no risk-of-bias analysis and quality of evidence assessments were performed\nas part of this scoping review. Therefore, care is recommended when deciding which factors\nto target in future intervention designs to optimise the antenatal vaccination rates as an\nintegral part of a life-course preventative approach [26,29,30].\n6. Conclusions\nThis analysis, within a 5A framework, illuminates the intricate web of factors that\nshape maternal vaccination uptake in Ireland. From knowledge gaps to healthcare provider\nperspectives, risk perceptions, and safety considerations, the narrative encompasses a\ndiverse range of determinants that are likely responsible for the low maternal vaccination\nrates observed. Potential effective strategies for improving antenatal vaccination uptake are\nconsistent and sustained recommendations by HCPs, including reminders in antenatal care\npacks and targeted public awareness campaigns, along with optimal utilization of social\nmedia. By addressing the identified barriers and harnessing facilitators, a roadmap can be\ncharted towards a landscape where maternal vaccination is embraced as a critical part of a\nlife-course immunization strategy, fostering the well-being of both mothers and infants. It\nis paramount to recognize that national immunization programmes need realignment and\nredesign with inter-stakeholder and inter-agency participation to ensure comprehensive\nprotection for individuals across the lifespan. By adopting a life-course approach to immu-\nnization, with maternal vaccination as the pivotal central point, vaccination programmes\ncould close immunity gaps at various life stages.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://\nwww.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/vaccines13060557/s1, Figure S1: Immunisation Schedule; Table S1:\nKeywords and search strategy; Table S2.

Introduction\nAlmost half of all child deaths occur in the first month of life [1], and 45% of under-five\nmortality is from infectious diseases [2]. For the mother–infant dyad, pregnancy and early\ninfancy are vulnerable windows for infection [3]. The pregnant mother’s physiology and\nimmunology undergo gestation-specific changes, increasing the risk of severe disease [4,5]. In\nparallel, the foetus develops an independent immune system, reaching relative maturity around\nthree months after birth, making newborn infants highly susceptible to infection [6,7]. During\nthis critical stage (and beyond), the maternal immune system provides passive protection to\nthe foetus and newborn via the transfer of antibodies and antimicrobial proteins via placental\ncirculation, and subsequently through colostrum and breast milk [8]. Colostrum is regarded as\n‘nature’s first vaccine’, enriched with IgA antibodies and a multitude of bioactive properties [1,2].\nPreterm infants pose additional challenges as they lack the opportunity for the trans-placental\nantibody (IgG) transfer that occurs in the last trimester [1]. Boosting immunity through maternal\nvaccination is a key strategy in protecting pregnant women and their infants against infectious\ndiseases and reducing their severity , and is thus unique in providingtransgenerational primary\npreventionthrough a single intervention [1].\nVaccination in pregnancy confers valuable passive protection to the newborn. His-\ntorically, the only vaccination offered in pregnancy globally was against neonatal tetanus\n(tetanus toxoid, TT) [ 3]. While the prevalence of neonatal tetanus has dramatically de-\ncreased around the world, it remains a preventable cause of death in low and middle-\nincome countries (LMIC), posing a high mortality rate of 10–60% despite treatment [3,4].\nMore recently, low-dose diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine components were\nadded, resulting in the Tdap maternal vaccine offering a triple prevention through one\nimmunization strategy [5,6].\nThe WHO recommends maternal vaccination against respiratory pathogens, influenza,\nand pertussis (whooping cough) in all pregnancies [ 9,10]. More recently, COVID-19 is\nrecommended on a risk-to-benefit basis [11]. The consequences of influenza in pregnancy\nextend beyond maternal health, from increased hospitalization due to cardiorespiratory\ncomplications to increased risk of stillbirth [12–14]. There is little evidence that influenza\ninfects the foetus [15]; however, young infants (<6 months) have high hospitalization rates,\nprolonged stays in intensive care units, and increased mortality [16–18]. While pertussis can\naffect all age groups, pertussis-associated complications are more common among young\ninfants [19,20]. Infants with pertussis often develop vomiting, cyanosis, apnoea, pneumonia,\nneurological complications, and sometimes death [21,22]. Furthermore, infections are easily\ntransmitted from older children, mothers, and adults whose milder symptoms may go\nunnoticed [23,24]. While relatively new, COVID-19 during antenatal and perinatal periods\nis associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes, such as pre-eclampsia, preterm\ndelivery, foetal loss, and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection manifested by fever,\npneumonia, and gastrointestinal symptoms [25].\nMore recently, the WHO and UNICEF recommended a global paradigm shift in the\nimmunization strategy by adopting a life-course approach (LCA) to immunization, which\ninvolves vaccination programmes tailored to close immunity gaps at different stages of\nlife. Maternal vaccination plays a pivotal role in this journey [ 26–29]. Maternal COVID-\n19 mRNA vaccination rollout and uptake over a relatively short timeframe during the\npandemic could galvanise worldwide momentum and boost acceptance of the safety', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}'), Document(id_='71ee909c-1921-41ee-9342-eedb36c7258c', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '3', 'file_name': 'PMC12197377.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/data/PMC12197377.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 356826, 'creation_date': '2025-07-11', 'last_modified_date': '2025-07-11'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='Vaccines 2025, 13, 557 3 of 15\noffered by antenatal vaccination, which occupies a strategic mid-position in the life-course\nvaccination spectrum from infancy to older adults [ 30]. Promotion of the interest and\nmotivation engendered by the pandemic would be an opportunity to increase the adult\nvaccination rate globally, including vaccines recommended antenatally [30].\nTo support vaccine uptake, national organizations recommend specific vaccine pro-\ntocols in pregnancy. In Ireland, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC)\nof the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) advises the following: one dose of\ninfluenza vaccine at any time in pregnancy [31], one dose of Tdap vaccine between 16 and\n36 weeks or any time after 36 weeks of pregnancy to maximise neonatal antibody level [32],\nand one course of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination at any point in pregnancy [ 33]. Both\ninfluenza vaccination and Tdap demonstrate no increased risk for adverse maternal or\nfoetal outcomes [34–37]. However, vaccine coverage, disease surveillance, efficacy, and\nsafety need continuous monitoring. This was highlighted in 2012 with a resurgence in\npertussis cases globally [ 19], and Ireland grappled with a 301% increase in cases from\n114 to 458 over a 2-year period [ 38,39]. Neonatal fatalities underscored the urgency of\nvaccination, with three deaths among unvaccinated infants <2 months of age [38,39]. Later,\nthe 2015/2016 flu season was characterised by a resurgence in the pandemic H1N1 strain,\nand its associated hospitalizations underscored the urgency of maternal immunization [40].\nDespite clear recommendations, maternal vaccination rates in Ireland remain low [38].\nHowever, the uptake of childhood vaccines included in the National Immunization Pro-\ngramme (Supplementary File) is satisfactory despite the recent challenges posed by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies shed light on factors affecting maternal vaccina-\ntion [41]. This scoping review aims to map and summarise factors influencing maternal\nvaccination in Ireland, employing Thomson et al.’s 5A framework, a taxonomy of vac-\ncine determinants: access, affordability, awareness, acceptance, and activation [42]. This\nframework focuses on the potential root causes of vaccine coverage gaps, outside of so-\nciodemographic factors. By examining these, we can identify barriers and facilitators\nrelated to maternal vaccination in Ireland, ultimately informing targeted interventions to\nimprove vaccination uptake among pregnant women. This review fills a gap in the existing\nliterature, offering valuable insights into the specific context of maternal vaccination in\nIreland. Observations from this review would also have a transferable relevance to optimise\nmaternal immunization in other countries.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Study Design\nThis review uses a scoping methodology [ 43,44]. The process for conducting the\nreview was divided into five stages: identification of the research question; identification of\nrelevant studies; selection of relevant studies; charting the data; and collating, summarising,\nand reporting the results. The conduct and reporting of results were further guided by the\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Extension\nfor Scoping Reviews [45].\n2.2. Statement of Research Question\nThis scoping review maps the available literature on maternal vaccination in Ireland\nand aims to answer: “What factors contribute to the acceptance or refusal of maternal\nvaccination in Ireland?”\n2.3. Identification of Relevant Studies\nTo identify relevant articles, a search of multiple electronic databases was performed\nduring the period March 2023 to May 2023: Embase; EBSCO (Academic Search Complete,', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}'), Document(id_='78ccb9b3-222b-467c-822d-e8e476b07078', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'PMC12197377.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/data/PMC12197377.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 356826, 'creation_date': '2025-07-11', 'last_modified_date': '2025-07-11'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='Vaccines 2025, 13, 557 4 of 15\nCINAHL, APA PsycInfo, and Medline); PubMed; Scopus; Web of Science; and the Irish\nhealth research repository—Lenus. The search strategy utilised a Population–Concept–\nContext (PCC) framework, with the population being pregnant women, the concept being\nvaccine uptake/hesitancy, and the context being Ireland. The keywords used for the search\nstrategy included terms related to pregnant women, vaccination, hesitancy/uptake, and\nIreland. The detailed search strategy (Table S1) and an example optimised for PubMed are\ndescribed in the Supplementary Materials. Searches were conducted from the inception\nof the databases, with the exception of Lenus, where search results were limited to 2013\nto 2023 and search terms were restricted (Table S1). An English language limitation was\napplied, and the reference lists of selected articles were hand-searched to identify additional\nrelevant studies.\n2.4. Selection of Relevant Studies\nTo enable screening and selection of relevant studies, search results were imported into\nEndnote® citation manager and then exported into Rayyan®, an online screening platform\nfor systematic reviews [46]. After removing duplicates, the screening process involved title\nand abstract screening, followed by a full-text assessment by two independent reviewers\n(AS, SB) applying inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in Table 1. Where only an\nabstract was available, authors were contacted by email to establish if a full-length article\nwas available. If not, it was excluded. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion\nwith senior authors (NI, RKP).\nTable 1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nInclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria\nPopulation: pregnant women or women of reproductive age Studies conducted outside of Ireland.\nConcept: factors influencing maternal vaccination Studies focusing solely on non-pregnant women.\nContext: Studies conducted in Ireland.

Studies not written in English.\nMethodological approaches: quantitative, qualitative,\nmixed-method studies. Studies with insufficient data or inadequate reporting.\n2.5. Charting the Data\nStudy data was extracted and charted in by two of the authors (AS and SB) using Excel\nas follows: title; author; year of publication; study aim/purpose; study design/methodology;\npopulation and sample size; location of study; vaccine type; and factors associated with\nuptake/hesitancy . To facilitate the identification and extraction of factors encompassed by\nThomson et al.’s 5A taxonomy (Table S2) [42], qualitative analysis software, Nvivo®, was\nused. Thomson’s 5A framework was used as the coding framework. The definitions of the\n5A dimensions are as follows: ‘access’—the ability of individuals to be reached by , or to\nreach, recommended vaccines; ‘affordability’—the ability of individuals to afford vaccination,\nboth in terms of financial and non-financial costs (e.g., time); ‘awareness’—the degree to\nwhich individuals have knowledge of the need for, and availability of, recommended vaccines\nand their objective benefits and risks; ‘acceptance’—the degree to which individuals accept,\nquestion, or refuse vaccination; ‘activation’—the degree to which individuals are nudged\ntowards vaccination uptake [42]. Articles were coded to these dimensions. For multinational\nstudies, results relevant/specific to the Irish population were extracted where possible.\n2.6. Collating, Summarizing, and Reporting the Results\nInformation from selected studies was collated and summarised in tables, and re-\nsults of the screening and selection process were summarised using the PRISMA flow\ndiagram [47].

Results\nSearches of nine electronic databases yielded 2458 results, with one article found\nthrough a hand search. Among these, 865 references were sourced from the Irish health\nresearch repository, Lenus, while 43 were obtained from PubMed. After screening, the\nauthors of four conference abstracts that were not found as full texts were contacted and\nconfirmed that one was never published, and another formed part of a study already\nincluded. The final number of articles included in the review was 12 (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. PRISMA flow diagram reporting search results, screening, and exclusion decisions.

Study Characteristics\nAmong the twelve studies selected for review, seven were quantitative, two qualitative,\nand three used mixed methods. There were four cohort studies and two cross-sectional\nstudies. Two studies were connected, as the sampled participants were from the same\ncohort. Participants in the studies included pregnant women (6/12—50% of studies), post-\npartum women or breastfeeding women (3/12—25%), hospital and community health care\nproviders (HCPs) (3/12—25%), and one study linked to the congenital anomaly register.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}'), Document(id_='10cdb78c-6003-4845-b107-3e949fe39a86', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'PMC12197377.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/data/PMC12197377.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 356826, 'creation_date': '2025-07-11', 'last_modified_date': '2025-07-11'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='Vaccines 2025, 13, 557 6 of 15\nParticipants were recruited at maternity hospitals in 25% of studies, antenatal clinics associ-\nated with maternity hospitals (17%), at GP clinics (17%), and from the general community\nvia online and in-person market research approaches (25%). Six studies (50%) examined\nboth influenza and pertussis vaccination, three studies (25%) focused on influenza, one\non pertussis vaccination alone, and two studies on willingness to receive the COVID-19\nvaccine. Studies were distributed nationally, with four conducted in Dublin, one national\nstudy covering the Republic of Ireland, one reported from Northern Ireland in the Belfast\nregion, and two international comparative studies (one covering 6 European countries and\nthe other analysing data from 24, including Ireland) (Tables S3 and S4).\n3.2. Sociodemographic Characteristics Associated with Maternal Vaccination\nOverall, the reported vaccination uptake rates in pregnant or post-partum women\nranged from 40 to 55.1% for influenza and 31 to 67% for Tdap vaccination [48–50]. Sociode-\nmographic characteristics statistically associated with vaccine uptake were maternal age\n>30 [48,51–53] and higher socioeconomic status [48,51,54]. Higher educational attainment\nwas associated with better influenza vaccination in pregnancy [48]. One study reported\nvaccination was more common in those identifying as Irish descent, while those women\noriginally from Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia/Middle East were less likely to be vac-\ncinated [51]. During the 2017/18 Influenza season in Ireland, 241 pregnant women were\nenrolled in a cross-sectional survey, yielding an influenza and pertussis vaccine uptake of\n61.7% and 49.9%, respectively [54].\n3.3. The 5A Factors Associated with Maternal Vaccination\nApplying Thomson’s 5A taxonomy , the proportion of studies reporting factors associated\nwith maternal vaccination uptake or hesitancy in the 5A dimensions were: 10/12 (83%) ac-\nceptance, 5/12 (42%) access, 7/12 (58%) affordability , 9/12 (75%) awareness, and 3/12 (25%)\nactivation (Table S4).\n3.4. Acceptance\n3.4.1. Individual Characteristics\nIndividual characteristics associated with maternal vaccination were pregnancy status,\ntrust, and health beliefs. Historically , antenatal vaccination uptake (excluding tetanus toxoid\non a global scale) remained suboptimal [54]. Those more likely to report being vaccinated or\nwilling to receive a vaccine were in their first pregnancy (primigravida), at gestational stage\n>20 weeks, had their first birth (primiparous), or were breastfeeding [52,53,55]. In contrast,\nunplanned pregnancy was associated with reduced uptake of the influenza vaccine [51]. In\ngeneral, women conveyed trust in their HCP , knowledge, and advice [52,56,57]. However, a\nqualitative study demonstrated that a lack of consistency in care providers made it difficult\nto build trust [57]. The same study revealed a bias towards medication avoidance during\npregnancy extending to immunizations as well [57]. This latter view was also held by some\nGPs in a study conducted in the West of Ireland [49].\n3.4.2. Perception of Illness\nOne quantitative study showed that a higher proportion of pregnant women perceived\nthat pertussis or influenza infection would be more dangerous for the infant than them-\nselves [56]. Another study of COVID-19 vaccine uptake showed 5278/6661 (86%) of pregnant\nwomen believed severe COVID-19 during pregnancy could affect foetal development [55].\nThis concern for the safety of the infant was paramount and also arose in qualitative find-\nings [52,57]. Another study demonstrated most women (157/198—79%) agreed they were\nmore vulnerable to illness during pregnancy than when not pregnant [ 48]. Among the\nsurveyed HCPs, 883/1180 (74.8%) agreed that influenza in pregnancy increased the risk of', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}'), Document(id_='5d77b169-f44a-4e5a-a600-2f32dd65b1d5', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '7', 'file_name': 'PMC12197377.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/data/PMC12197377.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 356826, 'creation_date': '2025-07-11', 'last_modified_date': '2025-07-11'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='Vaccines 2025, 13, 557 7 of 15\nfoetal complications. However, only 615/1180 (52.1%) identified that it could lead to preterm\ndelivery , miscarriage, and foetal death [48].\n3.4.3. Social Context of HCPs\nHCPs’ influence was a key determinant of maternal immunization uptake in multiple\nstudies [50,52,54,56–58]. A recommendation from a GP was the most common reason for\nvaccine uptake in two studies [48,54], and in another, inadequate information from HCPs\nwas the most common reason for non-uptake [50]. Qualitative studies revealed a lack of\nconsistency in how regularly or intently HCPs discussed and recommended vaccination.\nSome vaccinated women highlighted HCPs’ lack of engagement and multidisciplinary coor-\ndination [54,58] and the need for more vaccine-related discussion during appointments [57].\nSome unvaccinated women reported they were neither offered a vaccine nor discussed its\nmerits or safety with any HCP but would accept the vaccine if recommended [ 51,57,58].\nOthers perceived the vaccine was not important in pregnancy, if not endorsed by HCPs [57].\nIn one quantitative study, 54/113 (48%) of HCPs answered they never discussed pertussis\nvaccination with pregnant patients [50].\nLimited peer influence was observed in the reviewed studies. Friends and family were\nconsidered sources of information [50,57]; however, their influence was not considered a\nmajor factor in decision making [58]. Social and family responsibility coupled with ‘uptake\nconflict’ was represented in pregnant women’s priority to protect the infant from perceived\nadverse effects [48,52,57]. One study noted that protection of infants from influenza was\nthe most common reason for uptake [48]. Pregnant women felt it was more important to\nprotect the baby than themselves, but did not understand vaccination as a means to protect\nthe infant via passive immunization [57]. In parallel, GPs more than other HCPs felt it was\ntheir responsibility and role to recommend (101/109—92.9%) and offer (100/109—91.7%)\nthe vaccine [48], and female HCPs were more likely to do so [49].\n3.4.4. Vaccine\nConcern about vaccine safety was a common reason for HCPs choosing not to rec-\nommend vaccination [48–50,52,54]. In one study, 81% of GPs who did not recommend\npertussis vaccination had safety concerns versus 29% of recommending GPs [49]. HCPs’\nsafety concerns predominantly related to insufficient data in pregnancy and the potential\nfor future complications [49]. Maternal concern about vaccine-mediated harm to the foe-\ntus was paramount and associated with reduced uptake [48,52]. Two qualitative studies\nrevealed that concerns about vaccine safety derived from a perceived risk of vaccination\nand development of long-term conditions (narcolepsy and autism), despite this being\ndisproven [51,57,58]. Conversely, knowing a vaccine was safe was associated with uptake\nor uptake intent [50].\nNegative perceived efficacy arose as a factor in one qualitative study where pregnant\nwomen reported that they knew someone who received the flu vaccine but also developed\nflu [54]. However, women who had received a vaccine in a previous pregnancy or had\nbeen vaccinated for influenza were more likely to be vaccinated for pertussis, indicating a\npositive attitude to vaccination [55,58].\n3.5. Affordability\nNo studies explicitly examined the relationship between vaccine affordability in Ire-\nland and vaccine uptake. However, four studies observed that maternal vaccination uptake\nwas influenced by public or private funding of antenatal care. Women receiving publicly\nfunded care were less likely to receive or express intent to accept vaccination compared to\nwomen receiving privately funded care [48,51–53]. In an international comparative study,\npublic policy on funding of vaccination during pregnancy differed between countries [59].', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}'), Document(id_='c289c22d-b0e9-4dcd-97eb-00a6f683ed86', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '8', 'file_name': 'PMC12197377.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/data/PMC12197377.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 356826, 'creation_date': '2025-07-11', 'last_modified_date': '2025-07-11'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='Vaccines 2025, 13, 557 8 of 15\nCurrently, in Ireland, there is no patient-level cost for vaccinations included in the national\nimmunization schedule, although previously an administration fee was applied [ 49,60].\nFewer than 20% of GPs felt women were declining the pertussis vaccine due to financial\ncost [49]. Following a national vaccine funding policy change triggered by a pertussis\noutbreak, vaccine administration fees were removed in an effort to increase uptake [54,61].\nOne qualitative study reported lack of time, affording unpaid time off work, and obtaining\nchildcare as barriers to vaccination [57].\n3.6. Access\n3.6.1. Convenience\nGPs were reported as most commonly administering vaccines, and women praised\nvaccine availability at community GP visits [ 48,54,58]. Vaccines were also delivered by\npharmacists, midwives and hospital doctors, occupational health services, and nurses in GP\nclinics [54,58]. Notably, a qualitative study revealed that some women felt having to attend\na GP specifically for vaccination was inconvenient, and vaccines could be administered by\nmidwives during antenatal appointments [57]. A quantitative study of HCPs’ attitudes to\nvaccination revealed that the majority of pharmacists and hospital doctors were of the view\nthat vaccination should be administered in any location [ 48]. A contemporary study of\npregnant women indicated that antenatal pertussis vaccine was not discussed sufficiently\nin the hospital environment [58].\n3.6.2. Location of Vaccination\nOne study noted differences in uptake of maternal vaccination according to location,\nwith pregnant women living in the western (Connacht) or northern (Ulster) provinces\nless likely to be vaccinated than those in the east (Leinster) [54]. The same study showed\na greater uptake of influenza vaccine in rural areas, but an inverted relationship with\npertussis vaccination [54].\n3.6.3. Contact with Healthcare Systems\nTwo pregnancy-related factors, unplanned pregnancy and late booking (gestational\nstage >20 weeks at the first booking visit with antenatal care), were associated with reduced\nlikelihood of being vaccinated for influenza [51]. These factors may be viewed as reasons\nand evidence for less contact with the health system during the course of pregnancy, and\npossibly less opportunity to access information on vaccination. However, being in the later\nstages of gestation (>20 weeks) was also associated with increased willingness to receive\nthe COVID-19 vaccine [62].\n3.7. Awareness\nFactors relating to the degree of awareness and knowledge individuals have of vacci-\nnation were identified in multiple studies and are categorised by the pregnant women’s or\nHCPs’ awareness/knowledge.\n3.7.1. Women’s Knowledge of Vaccines and Vaccine Schedule\nThree studies examined pregnant women’s awareness and knowledge of vaccina-\ntion [50,57,58]. Two identified most pregnant women were aware of vaccination, irrespec-\ntive of intent [50,57]. Specifically for pertussis vaccination, a qualitative study revealed\nthat 7/17 post-partum women had not heard of antenatal pertussis vaccination [ 58]. In\nanother study, over half the participants were unsure if there were risks associated with\ninfluenza vaccination in pregnancy [ 58]. In contrast, a quantitative study revealed that\npregnant women’s knowledge of either influenza or pertussis vaccine safety in pregnancy\nwas associated with better uptake [50].', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}'), Document(id_='2c949ba1-b7ba-4aeb-87e6-bff222780068', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '9', 'file_name': 'PMC12197377.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/data/PMC12197377.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 356826, 'creation_date': '2025-07-11', 'last_modified_date': '2025-07-11'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='Vaccines 2025, 13, 557 9 of 15\n3.7.2. HCPs’ Knowledge of Vaccines and Vaccine Schedule\nThree studies examined HCPs’ awareness and knowledge of vaccination in pregnancy , re-\nvealing high overall awareness but varying levels of knowledge on specific guidelines [48–50].\nOne single site study of non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) and midwives found 95%\nwere aware of the national recommendations for influenza and pertussis vaccination during\npregnancy [50]. One national online survey , mostly of GPs and pharmacists, found 97.6%\nknew influenza vaccination was recommended, but only 75.6% knew about pertussis vaccine\nrecommendation [48]. Furthermore, for NCHDs and midwives, the majority lacked specific\nknowledge of the schedule for pertussis vaccination, specifically its reduced effectiveness if\ngiven in the last weeks of pregnancy and its recommendation for unvaccinated women within\none week of birth [50].\n3.7.3. Availability of Information\nGPs were the most common sources of information and considered reliable, but obste-\ntricians, hospital doctors, midwives, antenatal classes, and healthcare settings in general\nwere also common sources of information [ 48,50,54,56–58]. Information was provided\nin the form of discussions and also through public health information leaflets [ 54]. A\nqualitative study identified that women felt leaflets in the absence of discussion were not\nhelpful [57]. Outside of healthcare settings, information was obtained through friends and\nfamily, social media, websites, and literature [48,54,57,58], and pregnant women compared\ninformation from different sources with the public health information [26]. With respect to\nCOVID-19 vaccination, pregnant women valued scientific information, but there were also\ndifferences in the interpretation of data [52].\n3.8. Activation\n3.8.1. Prompts and Reminders\nOne study noted that during a pertussis outbreak, letters were sent to GPs and public\nhealth nurses, possibly mediating the observed increase in vaccination [ 54]. Crucially,\nstructured educational programmes and support for HCPs were recommended to address\nHCP vaccine confidence and hesitancy to recommend, and to enable effective communica-\ntion with patients for shared decision making [48–50,52,55,56]. To initiate a direct vaccine\nactivation of pregnant women, GPs recommend that a pertussis vaccination reminder be\nincluded in maternity notes and antenatal information packs [49,56].\n3.8.2. Workplace Policies\nVaccination for influenza and pertussis is recommended for HCPs working with infants\nin Ireland and should be offered by employers [63]. HCP uptake of vaccines was examined\nin two studies. Both revealed that many HCPs still chose not to be vaccinated [48,50]. The\nmajority (76%) of NCHDs and midwives had not been vaccinated against seasonal influenza at\nthe time of study and did not intend to receive it [50]. In contrast, in an online survey of HCPs\n(432 GPs, 417 pharmacists, and 29 hospital clinical staff), only a minority (267/878—30.4%)\nhad not received the vaccine [48].\n4. Discussion\nThis scoping review reaffirms the primacy of pregnant women’s sense of responsibility\nand intent to protect their unborn infant, and the positive influence of HCPs as the major\ninfluencing factor in maternal vaccination uptake. HCP recommendations are positively\nassociated with uptake, but their delivery—in terms of frequency and sufficiency of in-\nformation provided—is lacking. Effective communication of vaccine risks and benefits is\nhampered, complicating pregnant women’s decision to be vaccinated due to unassuaged', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}'), Document(id_='becbbf8c-ae4b-4ced-bc29-585cb4577f5d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '10', 'file_name': 'PMC12197377.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/data/PMC12197377.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 356826, 'creation_date': '2025-07-11', 'last_modified_date': '2025-07-11'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='Vaccines 2025, 13, 557 10 of 15\nconcerns for vaccine safety for herself and even more for the unborn infant. The reticence\nof some healthcare providers to recommend vaccination is attributed to concerns about\npotential vaccine adverse effects and is exacerbated by a lack of support from the hierarchy.\nThis remains a formidable hurdle. Pregnant women seek sources of information outside\nof healthcare settings to inform their decisions, indicating a wider potential sphere of\ninfluence, and public awareness campaigns have proved effective, overcoming established\nsociodemographic barriers to vaccination acceptance in Ireland. This is particularly rel-\nevant in the post-COVID-19 era by countering misinformation in a timely and effective\nmanner, cultivating a culture of antenatal vaccine acceptance through targeted antenatal\neducation of women and HCPs, and ensuring equitable access through interdisciplinary\ncoordination [26,30].\nHealthcare professionals wield substantial social influence in shaping vaccine confi-\ndence among pregnant women, as identified in a recent meta-analysis [ 64]. However, a\ndivergence of views within the healthcare community regarding vaccine safety highlights\nthe need for comprehensive safety data to bolster providers’ confidence. To the authors’\nknowledge, there is no routine monitoring of pregnancy-specific vaccine safety indicators,\nand a robust system for the timely dissemination of the collated information to the HCPs\ninvolved in maternal immunization in Ireland, thus hampering HCPs decisions to rec-\nommend and also leaving them ill-equipped to answer questions on vaccine safety from\npregnant mothers, compounding maternal vaccine hesitancy.\nIn the reviewed studies, neither access nor affordability arose as notable barriers\nto maternal immunization in an Irish context, while vaccination programmes among\nsub-populations in some European regions were reported to be negatively influenced by\npatient-level and provider-level affordability concerns [65]. However, in the majority of the\nincluded studies, pregnant or post-partum women were recruited at sites of access, such as\nGP clinics, or potential access, such as maternity hospitals, and so this was unlikely to be a\nbarrier for these participants. Expanding access by widening who can provide vaccines,\nspecifically antenatal services and pharmacies, has been shown to increase uptake [66–68].\nQuestions around accessibility, beyond GP clinics, remain, and previous studies have\nidentified time, storage issues, and availability of staff certified to administer vaccines as\nchallenges to access [69,70]. Affordability was not an issue due to free provision under\nIrish policy; however, it is unclear why privately funded obstetric care is associated with\nbetter pregnancy-specific vaccine uptake compared to publicly funded obstetric care. This\nassociation is found in studies from the US, Europe, and Australia, as recently reviewed\nby Geoghegan et al. [52]. In the US, this is thought to be due, in part, to high demand on\npublic services, HCP decisions according to insurance coverage, and HCP-perceived ability\nto pay [71].\nA significant gap was observed in provider training and support that is intensifying\nvaccine hesitancy among pregnant women. For women, this combination of shortfalls\nmay create an omission bias where women choose no action rather than a potential yet\nimprobable harm to their infant [42]. Similar factors were identified in a scoping review\nby MacDougall et al. [ 72]. Future research should establish the informational needs of\npregnant women and complementary HCP training. Increasing knowledge and awareness\nof the importance of maternal vaccination and its efficacy are important strategies for\nincreasing vaccination coverage [26,73].\nFurther to the completion of this scoping review, the largest antenatal survey of\npregnant women in Europe on awareness, acceptability, and willingness to receive RSV\nmaternal vaccination was published from Ireland [74]. Of 528 women, a large proportion\n(75.6%) had never heard of RSV , yet 48.5% would still avail themselves of a vaccine, 45.8%\nwere undecided, and only 5.3% would not.

Since the completion of our data synthesis, one scoping\nreview and one qualitative systematic review on related aspects of maternal immunization\nhighlighted women’s need for clear information, ideally provided by their healthcare\nprofessionals, in a meaningful way that addresses identified barriers [75,76]. Governments,\nregulatory authorities, and HCPs have to collectively educate pregnant women about the\neffectiveness and safety of maternal vaccines and encourage vaccination when the benefits\noutweigh the risks [77]. Consistent and evidence-enabled recommendations from HCPs,\nwith mindfulness of the sociodemographic and cultural background of pregnant women,\nwould foster the acceptance of vaccination in pregnancy as an essential component of\nantenatal care. Global experience and lessons learned from the rollout of the COVID-19\nvaccination during the antenatal period provided valuable insights that can inform current\nand future approaches to optimise maternal vaccination strategies [30,78].\n5. Limitations\nThomson’s 5A taxonomy is based on factors supported by evidential statements, and\nwe conducted this scoping review in a similar manner, examining each study for factors\ninfluencing or related to the maternal vaccine coverage landscape in Ireland. However,\ndue to the limited number of quantitative studies and study designs, the majority of\nfactors identified, while often supported by qualitative findings, do not represent statistical\nassociations with vaccine uptake. Additionally, unlike in a systematic review, no critical\nappraisal of the literature was conducted to determine the rigour and validity of the\nfindings, and no risk-of-bias analysis and quality of evidence assessments were performed\nas part of this scoping review. Therefore, care is recommended when deciding which factors\nto target in future intervention designs to optimise the antenatal vaccination rates as an\nintegral part of a life-course preventative approach [26,29,30].\n6. Conclusions\nThis analysis, within a 5A framework, illuminates the intricate web of factors that\nshape maternal vaccination uptake in Ireland. From knowledge gaps to healthcare provider\nperspectives, risk perceptions, and safety considerations, the narrative encompasses a\ndiverse range of determinants that are likely responsible for the low maternal vaccination\nrates observed. Potential effective strategies for improving antenatal vaccination uptake are\nconsistent and sustained recommendations by HCPs, including reminders in antenatal care\npacks and targeted public awareness campaigns, along with optimal utilization of social\nmedia. By addressing the identified barriers and harnessing facilitators, a roadmap can be\ncharted towards a landscape where maternal vaccination is embraced as a critical part of a\nlife-course immunization strategy, fostering the well-being of both mothers and infants. It\nis paramount to recognize that national immunization programmes need realignment and\nredesign with inter-stakeholder and inter-agency participation to ensure comprehensive\nprotection for individuals across the lifespan. By adopting a life-course approach to immu-\nnization, with maternal vaccination as the pivotal central point, vaccination programmes\ncould close immunity gaps at various life stages.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://\nwww.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/vaccines13060557/s1, Figure S1: Immunisation Schedule; Table S1:\nKeywords and search strategy; Table S2.
